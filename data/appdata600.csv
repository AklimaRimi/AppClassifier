"Aegis Implicit Mail is a free and open source library which is designed to provide fast and developer friendly API to send emails using SMTP ports.

Binaries are available in the form of NuGet package:
https://www.nuget.org/packages/AIM

Please check http://pki.tools/aim.html as well

AIM Supports :
* None Ssl Mails
* Implicit Ssl Mails
* Explicit Ssl Mails
* Smtp Connection test
* Detect Ssl type of mail server
* Attachments for MIME and S/MIME message.
* In-line attachment and separate file attachment
* All content types and mimes
* SMIME , Signed and Encrypted mails
In an integrated way

Sadly, Microsoft.Net.Mail Ssl Mails does not support Implicit Ssl Mail and it is still used by many servers, including port 465 of Gmail here AIM comes to make a readable and fast alternative to send your smtp mails.

The Web Crawler Security is a python based tool to automatically crawl a web site. It is a web crawler oriented to help in penetration testing tasks. The main task of this tool is to search and list all the links (pages and files) in a web site.

The crawler has been completely rewritten in v1.0 bringing a lot of improvements: improved the data visualization, interactive option to download files, increased speed in crawling, exports list of found files into a separated file (useful to crawl a site once, then download files and analyse them with FOCA), generate an output log in Common Log Format (CLF), manage basic authentication and more!

Many of the old features has been reimplemented and the most interesting one is the capability of the crawler to search for directory indexing.Last update on tue mar 26 16:25 UTC 2012

The Web Crawler Security is a python based tool to automatically crawl a web site. It is a web crawler oriented to help in penetration testing tasks. The main task of this tool is to search and list all the links (pages and files) in a web site.

The crawler has been completely rewritten in v1.0 bringing a lot of improvements: improved the data visualization, interactive option to download files, increased speed in crawling, exports list of found files into a separated file (useful to crawl a site once, then download files and analyse them with FOCA), generate an output log in Common Log Format (CLF), manage basic authentication and more!

"A software policy makes a powerful addition to Microsoft Windows' malware protection.

In particular, it is more effective against ransomware than traditional approaches to security.

If you know about the Linux 'execute permission' bit then you'll understand what this is for. The mode of operation is somewhat different in that execute permission is granted to folders and subfolders rather than individual files, but the intention is the same, to stop undesirable or unknown software from launching unless you OK it.

Additionally, it is possible to specify that certain executables (typically browsers and email clients) are run with reduced rights. This is a valuable damage-limitation measure against browser plugin vulns, etc.

The protection can be turned off without a reboot whilst installing legitimate software, and will automatically reactivate after a specified timeA software policy makes a powerful addition to Microsoft Windows' malware protection.

"A simple but powerful cross-platform utility for managing and accessing your most secret data. It stores passwords and whole files, so it can literally store any information you want to keep secret. Access your most-used passwords/URLs right out of a desktop tray icon.

For advanced users, it includes a separate utility called Grypto-Transforms, which has a universal hash calculator with all the major hash functions, generic encrypt/decrypt functions and a base64/hex converter.

Although the interface is simple and intuitive, the security is top-notch. It uses AES with CCM to secure and authenticate the data.A simple but powerful cross-platform utility for managing and accessing your most secret data.
