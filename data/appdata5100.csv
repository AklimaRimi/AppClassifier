"XML is intolerant of errors. This program will automatically salvage XML files by finding the first XML error, then truncating a configurable number of characters before the error and finally using the great xmllint to recover the xml file by automatically adding the correct end tags. The program starts with a default of 50 characters truncation.

This truncation value may need to be changed if the truncation happens in the middle of a complex tag as xmllint may not know how to recover the file correctly. Additionally some extra text or data may be recoverable by changing the truncation amount to less than 50 characters.The extra truncation is needed in the first place because the XML validator used is not able to perfectly identify where the XML corruption begins and will often not flag the corruption for several characters after it begins.XML is intolerant of errors.

"The Systems Biology Format Converter (SBFC) is a Java generic framework aiming to translate any systems biology model format into another.

The SBFC Web Site providing detailed feature description and instructions for installing, using and developing new modules is: http://sbfc.sourceforge.net/ .

Currently, SBFC allows the user to convert SBML models into the formats: BioPax, Matlab, Octave, XPP, DOT, and SBGN. Due to its modular design fast development and addition of new converters is highly facilitated.

SBFC can be executed in two modes:
1. standalone executable downloading the package provided in this website;
2. web-service at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/tools/converters .

For general discussion about SBFC, please use the forum sbfc-forum@googlegroups.com .

A mailing-list is also available for developers: sbfc-devel@googlegroups.com
