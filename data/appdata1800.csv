"This is the most complete and standalone Sudoku puzzle suite for Windows. It includes comfort playing with undo steps and powerful Sudoku generator with different difficulty levels. Also you can create Sudoku game manually and print it on an A4/Letter paper. Tutorial mode with solving hints for newbies is included too. Also there is High Score table and built-in timer for professional players.

The Sudoku generation algorithm used by this app is my ultimate proud. Primarily it was based on a Deep Neural Network. But I analyzed more than 100 scientific publications on Sudoku generation problem and have reduced the Deep Neural Network to a relatively simple and very elegant deterministic algorithm that works pretty fast. As a result, the app can generate Sudoku fields in 7 difficulty levels from 'Yellow Belt' to 'Sudoku Game Jedi Master'.

The application supports Quick Start mode, see features below [QS Step 1] and [QS Step 2] (buttons in an application window).This is the most complete and standalone Sudoku puzzle suite for Windows.

"PyInstaller is a program that converts (packages) Python programs into stand-alone executables, under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, AIX and Solaris. Its main advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works with any version of Python since 2.3, it builds smaller executables thanks to transparent compression, it is fully multi-platform, and uses the OS support to load the dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full compatibility.

The main goal of PyInstaller is to be compatible with 3rd-party packages out-of-the-box. This means that, with PyInstaller, all the required tricks to make external packages work are already integrated within PyInstaller itself so that there is no user intervention required. You'll never be required to look for tricks in wikis and apply custom modification to your files or your setup scripts. As an example, libraries like PyQt, Django or matplotlib are fully supported, without having to handle plugins or external data files manually.PyInstaller is a program that converts (packages) Python programs into stand-alone executables, under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, AIX and Solaris.

"YAFU (with assistance from other free software) uses the most powerful modern algorithms (and implementations of them) to factor input integers in a completely automated way. The automation within YAFU is state-of-the-art, combining factorization algorithms in an intelligent and adaptive methodology that minimizes the time to find the factors of arbitrary input integers. Most algorithm implementations are multi-threaded, allowing YAFU to fully utilize multi- or many-core processors (including SNFS, GNFS, SIQS, and ECM).

YAFU is primarily a command-line driven tool. You provide the number to factor and, via screen output and log files, YAFU will provide you the factors. There is also an interactive environment similar to MATLAB or PARI/GP, where you can type commands and store results. YAFU is very customizable, through the optional use of many many command line parameters and a very capable expression interpreter.YAFU (with assistance from other free software) uses the most powerful modern algorithms (and implementations of them) to factor input integers in a completely automated way.

● LiPS gives sensitivity analysis procedures, which allow us to study the behaviour of the model when you change its parameters, including: analysis of changes in the right sides of constraints, analysis of changes in the coefficients of the objective function, analysis of changes in the column/row of the technology matrix. Such information may be extremely useful for the practical application of LP Models.
