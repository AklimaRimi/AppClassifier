"FORTRAN Unit Test Framework, written in FORTRAN 95. So that all FORTRAN features can be tested. FRUIT has assertion, fixture, setup, teardown, report, spec, driver generation. Rake used as build tool. Tutorials at http://fortranxunit.wiki.sourceforge.net

The Ruby code is to make fixtures and reports easier.

Rake is to build the project elegantly. This project also demonstrate a new way to build mixed language code in an alternative way than Make.

Most of the FORTRAN are important in nature, used in nuclear and aerospace codes, etc, and maintained and written actively. Please help to bring TDD practices to the FORTRAN community. The change could be very hard, personally, I quit, since I could not make the change. I hope your organization will be successful.
