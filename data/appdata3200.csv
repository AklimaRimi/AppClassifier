Transmission is a respected Fast, Easy, and Free BitTorrent Client, as from their site https://transmissionbt.com/about

Unofficial Windows build runs perfect either Windows service or daemon.

32 bit and 64 bit versions.
32 (runs everywhere), 64 only 64-bit Windows.

Decision made to maintain choice 2.7x core rather than somewhat buggy 2.8x-2.9x cores. That's why you will see infrequent and less bug fixes than official branches. All the features of 2.8x-2.9x (except rename). Run this solid 2.77+ port for extended days, it doesn't crash or lock. Prime for seedbox use.

The included remote GUI port is fine tuned to the daemon released here.

Temporary piece support. https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/532 plus many featured enhancements! Tested, stable enhancements users requested.

Specifically modified and bug tested for Linux GCC and Windows (cygwin gcc/g++) compilers.

Current release 14734-18 020619

The Skype Diceroller has become officially obsolete. Skype announced that they are discontinuing support for the Skype API, which the project depends on in order to read chat message data. Unfortunately, there isn't an alternative mechanism currently available to that would support the diceroller's functionality. This project is essentially on hiatus until a new API or other means of retrieving chat data from Skype becomes available.

Thank you all for downloading. It was fun to work on this project, and I hope to work on it more.
