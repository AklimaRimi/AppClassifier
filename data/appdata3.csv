"Salat calculates the prayer times for your location.

If your city is not in the database (unlikely, since it has 36,000 cities in it), just feed it the latitude and longitude of your place (Get that from Google Earth) and it will calculate the times of Namaz.

Options for calculating according to Hanafi and Shafe'ee schools of Jurisprudence.

Other options include Height of your location (which changes the salat timing...)

Now don't miss a prayer even if you are on the tip of Everest :)

You can also customize your Fajr and Isha timings with a customized twilight angle...depending on the traditions at your place.

Prepare customized printouts for the entire year...

All this with a Jazzy interface and Adans from Medina, Mecca and more...

Create reports for a month or year for anywhere on earth. Lunar Phase, Hijri Date are calculated accurately.

"A pronounceable password generator plugin for KeePass.


DISCLAIMER:
Compared to traditional randomly generated passwords of the same length, pronounceable passwords are inherently weaker against brute force attacks. Using pronounceable passwords sacrifice some resistance against brute force attacks to reduce the risk of inadvertent password exposure. Whether this trade-off is worth it or not depends entirely on your use case.

When using this application I recommend generating considerably longer passwords to make any brute force attack as difficult as possible. This application uses FIPS-181 for generating passwords and it is particularly vulnerable to brute force attacks that are targeted specifically towards the algorithm. I added modifications to the implementation (such as allowing the insertion of random numbers or symbols between syllables) with the intention of protecting against a targeted attack, but I cannot make any supported claims as to its effectiveness.A pronounceable password generator plugin for KeePass.

This enhanced security adds some delay ONLY to the opening of encrypted partitions without any performance impact to the application use phase. This is acceptable to the legitimate owner but it makes it much harder for an attacker to gain access to the encrypted data.

All released files are PGP signed with key ID=0x680D16DE, available on key servers and downloadable at https://www.idrix.fr/VeraCrypt/VeraCrypt_PGP_public_key.asc
