"LosslessCut aims to be the ultimate cross platform FFmpeg GUI for extremely fast and lossless operations on video, audio, subtitle and other related media files. The main feature is lossless trimming and cutting of video and audio files, which is great for saving space by rough-cutting your large video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc. It lets you quickly extract the good parts from your videos and discard many gigabytes of data without doing a slow re-encode and thereby losing quality. Or you can add a music or subtitle track to your video without needing to encode. Everything is extremely fast because it does an almost direct data copy, fueled by the awesome FFmpeg which does all the grunt work. Lossless merge/concatenation of arbitrary files (with identical codecs parameters, e.g. from the same camera).

"Meson Player is a very convenient music player if you don't need any GUI to control playback or manage playlists. You just run it and then forget about it. The player is running in background. Switching tracks, volume control, loading and saving playlists, all of this performed by using hotkeys. Therefore, you can control the player while working in any application.

Meson Player supports a lot of music file formats (stream and tracker), Internet radio and playlists management.

Supported OS:
- Windows 10 64-bit (1909 build)
- OSX 10.15 Catalina
- Kubuntu 19.10 Eoan Ermine 64-bit

Conway's Game of Life is generalized to a continuous domain. OpenGL and GLSL shaders are used for real-time 2D and 3D graphics. Time stepping is done via a real to complex FFT based convolution operation. There are also two deliberately simple test implementations in FreeBasic and Matlab. A 2D version on a sphere shows that it is really not dependent on the underlying grid.Conway's Game of Life is generalized to a continuous domain.

The package has a very easy to learn, high level interface that can be used to draw simple dependency trees, complex non projective graphs, bubble parses, and in general any kind of graph which is based on a sequence of nodes and edges among these.

It is based on PGF/TikZ and it can be used either with latex or pdflatex. It comes with a very comprehensive documentation that will get you started in 10 minutes, even without any prior knowledge of TikZ.

It also provides a lot of styling facilities, to let you personalize the look and feel of the graphs at your liking.TikZ-dependency allows you to draw dependency graphs in LaTeX documents with little or no effort.

"Fraqtive is an open source, multi-platform generator of the Mandelbrot family fractals. It uses very fast algorithms supporting SSE2 and multi-core processors. It generates high quality anti-aliased images and renders 3D scenes using OpenGL. It allows real-time navigation and dynamic generation of the Julia fractal preview.

"Route Generator is a tool to create animated routes on a map and generate a movie from it. This movie can be imported in your video editing software (e.g. Pinnacle Studio), so you can add it to your own movies.
The map can be imported from Google Maps or GeoTIFF, TIFF files.
The routes can be drawn manually or imported from a GPX file.Route Generator is a tool to create animated routes on a map and generate a movie from it. This movie can be imported in your video editing software (e.g. Pinnacle Studio), so you can add it to your own movies.

"Important: Groimp migrates to Gitlab. You can find the latest code and documentation at https://gitlab.com/grogra/groimp/-/wikis/home. The version on Sourceforge will not be updated anymore.

The modelling platform GroIMP is designed as an integrated platform which incorporates modelling, visualisation and interaction. It exhibits several features which makes itself suitable for the field of biological or ALife modelling:

The “modelling backbone” consists in the language XL. It is fully integrated, e.g., the user can interactively select the rules to be applied.
GroIMP provides classes that can be used in modelling: Turtle commands, further geometrical classes like bicubic surfaces, the class Cell which has been used in the Game Of Life implementation, and so on.
The outcome of a model is visualised within GroIMP.
In the visual representation of the model output, users can interact with the dynamics of the model, e.g., by selecting or deleting elements.Important: Groimp migrates to Gitlab.
