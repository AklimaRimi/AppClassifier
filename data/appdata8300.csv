"Octave Forge is a central location for collaborative development of packages for GNU Octave. The Octave Forge packages expand Octave's core functionality by providing field specific features via Octave's package system. See https://octave.sourceforge.io/packages.php for a list of all available packages.

GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable. Refer to https://www.octave.org for more information.Octave Forge is a central location for collaborative development of packages for GNU Octave.

"A multiplatform vector drawing program with a complete library of electronic symbols. Schematics and drawings are stored in a very compact text format. There is no netlist concept behind the drawings (so no simulation, and this is a choice) but this allows a great graphical flexibility and ease of use, making FidoCadJ the perfect tool for exchange sketches in forum and newsgroup discussions with a few clicks.

Drawings can be exported in several graphic formats, such as pdf.

For example, Maxima solves x^2-r*x-s^2-r*s=0 giving the symbolic results [x=r+s, x=-s].

Maxima can calculate with exact integers and fractions, native floating-point and high-precision big floats.

Maxima has user-friendly front-ends, an on-line manual, plotting commands, and numerical libraries. Users can write programs in its native programming language, and many have contributed useful packages in a variety of areas over the decades.
