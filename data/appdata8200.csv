"Messaging Workbench or MWB was developed by the late Peter Rontey at the Department of Veteran Affairs.

The tool allows an array of functionality most prominently allowing creation of conformance profiles, specification messages etc. based off of HL7 V2.x. The idea is to allow implementers to test their profiles/implementations before they begin participation in conformance and interoperability testing.

The tool is built using Delphi.

At the request of the HL7 community and the HL7 Tooling SIG, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is placing the MWB source into public domain. The objective behind putting this tool's source code is that the open-source developers will maintain and advance it’s features. All third party software has been removed. Therefore, in its current state the code does not compile. Please check-out the wiki for more information on the status of the source code.

Thanks.
