"SES brings back the uncrackable onetime pad, with a digital twist. It is well known that a random key of message-length is the only provably unbreakable cipher. SES uses cryptographic strength pseudo-random keys of message-length for its many encipherments, in addition to offering true one-time pad capability for the intrepid.

SES is built on ISAAC, Bob Jenkins' unbroken CSPRNG, a fast and simple stream cipher placed in the Public Domain in 1996. SES now gives you the ability to efficiently cipher text of arbitrary length or files of any size or type. Use it with confidence.

To achieve complete one-on-one privacy, SES traverses several levels en route to its output. The more words in your key-phrase, the more layers of encipherment SES applies. It is part Vigenere, part onetime pad, part cryptographic hash, not to mention the essential scrambler element, each component driven by ISAAC, with all key-derivation and stretching relying on Keccak in 512-bit configuration.SES brings back the uncrackable onetime pad, with a digital twist.

XMHF is no longer in active development. It is superseded by uberXMHF (uber eXtensible Micro-Hypervisor Framework) which is available at: http://uberxmhf.org
*****

XMHF is an eXtensible and Modular Hypervisor Framework that strives to be a comprehensible and flexible platform for performing hypervisor research and development. The framework allows others to build custom (security-sensitive) hypervisor-based solutions (called ""hypapps"").

XMHF advocates a ""rich"" single-guest execution model where the hypervisor framework supports only a single-guest and allows the guest direct access to all performance-critical system devices and device interrupts.

XMHF currently runs on recent multicore x86 hardware virtualized platforms with support for dynamic root of trust and nested (2-dimensional) paging. The framework is capable of running unmodified legacy multiprocessor capable OSes such as Windows and Linux.

"JCryptor uses the Caesar-cipher to encrypt keystrokes on-the-fly. It can also be used to decrypt an encrypted text easily. Caesar-cipher is a simple encryption algorithm, developed by Julius Caesar, to encrypt his correspondence with Cicero in the ancient world. Therefore it uses a simple character substitution method to replace a given character by another. A keyshift of thirteen is called ROT13. ROT13 can be decrypted by encrypting it again with ROT13. Even today this simple method is used by authorities to protect documents from unintentional reading.

The results of a job run are saved to an archive file. Subsequent runs of the job are compared to this archive to determine which files have changed.

"DENRIT allows remote administration of anonymous networks (TOR, I2P and FreeNet). Also, contains a pentesting module to execute commands using a selected anonymous network, pentesting with TOR or TCP
Follows a client/server model with well-defined communication interfaces. SSH is used to allow remote clients to access the machine and manage any anonymous network that is installed there, plus allows penetration testing anonymously (or non-anonymously) using tools such as Metasploit Framework, nmap, nikto, among others. The list of supported applications will grow as the project progresses. Until now, this project is under development and is very unstable (and some features aren't included). But I've been developing constantly and I think that soon this software will become stable and very useful to pentesters, hackers and researchers (I hope so!)
Well, you can see the wiki page and the presentation exposed in the download section if you want more information about this project.DENRIT allows remote administration of anonymous networks (TOR, I2P and FreeNet).

"Password safe for Windows and Linux.

If you want to manage your passwords (or other information) in one file and access that file with Windows and with Linux, this could be your choice.

You create trees where each knot and leaf contains as many key/value pairs as you like. Then the whole thing is written encrypted to one file.

Windows binaries and Debian32/64 binaries are downloadable. If you want to build it yourself - I suggest Linux users do that - get Qt4, call qmake and make in the directory where the .pro file is and you should be done. When building with Windows I suggest MinGw.

The encryption is taken from a c-sample from Bruce Schneiers site. If someone could check it, that would be nice.

"The idea is to enhance and develop the national border crossing process by the integration of automated vehicle recognition while crossing country borders.
i'm going to use Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR): a system that recognizes the numbers of the vehicle plates by using OCR (optical character recognition) technology and Infrared cameras.
This is going to be achieved by taking the license plate image from the camera and processing it using the software I’m going to develop together with an open source OCR system. The output is going to be a text version of the plate number. Then it is going to retrieve that number from a database and get the information of the vehicle owner.
Note: Please note that you need emgucv installed. you also need to move the project files to:
C:\Emgu\emgucv-windows-x86XXX\Emgu.CV.Example\
Please note: that the project was created using visual studio 2003, on windows xp. and it might not run fluently on newer versions. please try to update it.The idea is to enhance and develop the national border crossing process by the integration of automated vehicle recognition while crossing country borders.
