"Mail Alert Simple Mailer is a simple command-line utility designed for IT administrators for sending e-mail from Microsoft Windows OS. It can be executed from command line, Windows batch file or PowerShell scripts. My main reason for writing this software was to handle events generated by Dell OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA), APC PowerChute and Windows Events to send hardware status and alerts like temperature alerts, UPS battery status, powerline status and RAID controller alerts from monitoring software. It can be used with any other software where you can configure external application to be executed when specific event occurs.
Mail Alert Simple Mailer supports SSL and STARTTLS protocols, so it is compatible with many free e-mail providers like GMail, Hotmail, etc. Unlike other simple command line tools it supports ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2 and UTF-8 code pages for national characters.
