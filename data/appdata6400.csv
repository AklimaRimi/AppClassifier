Mara offers the kind of helpful features you would expect to find in the big commercial products, but in a more concise form. This makes it remarkably easy to use, even for the inexperienced content creator.

Features include direct editing of the actual webpage so you see your changes as you type, drag and drop photo and video content addition, easy YouTube video linking, a photo gallery that can also double as a presentation or lecture slideshow, a secure contact form, rollback of changes, plus much more.

For the experienced Web developer, Mara's use of industry standard HTML5 and CSS3 instead of proprietary markup or database structures makes for a shallower learning curve. If you already understand the fundamentals of webpage creation you can get productive really quickly.

Open source, unrestricted, and free to use. Coders are welcome to contribute themes or plugins to the project.","Categories
