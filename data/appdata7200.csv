"SmartBody is available for download for Windows, Linux and OSX users. SmartBody can also be used on Android and iOS platforms.

SmartBody is a character animation platform that provides the following capabilities in real time:
* Locomotion (walk, jog, run, turn, strafe, jump, etc.)
* Steering - avoiding obstacles and moving objects
* Object manipulation - reach, grasp, touch , pick up objects
* Lip Syncing - characters can speak with simultaneous lip-sync using text-to-speech or prerecorded audio
* Gazing - robust gazing behavior that incorporates various parts of the body
* Nonverbal behavior - gesturing, head nodding and shaking, eye saccades
- Online and offline retargeting of motion
- Automatic skinning and rigging

"K3DSurf (now MathMod) is a program to visualize and manipulate Mathematical models in three, four, five and six dimensions. K3DSurf supports Parametric equations and Isosurfaces.
******
Welcome to the realm of complex numbers!
Change-log for MathMod-11.1 (16/06/2021)
1) Support of graphing functions with complex numbers Z=u+iv in 3D and 4D spaces (demo scripts: ""Complex3D_xx"" and ""Complex4D_Saddle"")
2) Added support for HSV (hue, saturation, brightness) coloring model (script: ""Complex_Domain_Coloring"")
3) Texture definitions (RGB and HSV) for parametric surfaces can now be expressed as functions of complex numbers
4) Added a software implementation for the OpenGL variable gl_FrontFacing (fixed an issue with GPU drivers on MacOSX Catalina).
The activation of this patch is available from mathmodconfig.js (""OpenGlConfig""-->""GL_FrontFacingSupport""=false)

"In its day, Electric Duet was a technological marvel, allowing two-voice music to be played on Apple ][ hardware capable of generating only square waves with 1-bit resolution. ed2midi tries to convert those old music files into a midi format, usable on a variety of software systems today.In its day, Electric Duet was a technological marvel, allowing two-voice music to be played on Apple ][ hardware capable of generating only square waves with 1-bit resolution. ed2midi tries to convert those old music files into a midi format, usable on a variety of software systems today.","Categories

"Abstracts the hassle of HW accelerated decoding in Intel's 2nd generation Core i3/i5/i7/Pentium/Celeron (SandyBridge) or newer Intel CPU/GPU using the Intel QuickSync technology.

Started as an internal decoder within FFDShow. Can be easily ported to other DirectShow decoders.

The Intel QuickSync decoder is now used within FFDShow, LAV video decoder and PotPlayer.Abstracts the hassle of HW accelerated decoding in Intel's 2nd generation Core i3/i5/i7/Pentium/Celeron (SandyBridge) or newer Intel CPU/GPU using the Intel QuickSync technology.

"Scene is a computer vision framework that performs background subtraction and object tracking, using two traditional algorithms and three more recent algorithms based on neural networks and fuzzy classification rules. For each detected object, Scene sends TUIO messages to one or several client applications. The present release features GPU accelerated versions of all the background subtraction methods and morphological post processing of the object blobs with dilation and erosion filters, implemented in OpenCL. The framework was mainly designed as a toolkit for the rapid development of interactive art projects that explore dynamics of complex environments. The Scene GUI runs and compiles under Windows, Linux, and MacOS X, and is available in both 32 bit and 64 bit versions.Scene is a computer vision framework that performs background subtraction and object tracking, using two traditional algorithms and three more recent algorithms based on neural networks and fuzzy classification rules.

"This project started as a repository for information on Lexicon's Core-32 PCI-bus audio I/O adapter card and the companion LDI-10T / LDI-12T / PC-90 system components. The current focus is a combination of software and a custom hardware adapter to bridge the PCI bus to USB so the Core hardware will be able work with laptops and modern OS's.

This same software adapter could be used by any audio card that, like the Core, uses the DSP56301. Examples are the Event soundcards Mona, Darla, Gina, and Layla, the Kyma™, Digidesign PT-Project and PT-Mix, and M-Audio Lagoon.This project started as a repository for information on Lexicon's Core-32 PCI-bus audio I/O adapter card and the companion LDI-10T / LDI-12T / PC-90 system components.
