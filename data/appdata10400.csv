"LxPup is a version of Puppy Linux using the LXDE desktop environment and is an updated “descendent” of loukitchou’s LxPup13.01.
LxPup offers the Openbox window manager, LxPanel panel manager and PCManFM file manager.
There are various ""flavours"" of LxPup some built as derivatives of official Puppy Linux builds (based on Slackware and Ubuntu components) and one a new woof-ce build (Slackware based). The various flavours offer different kernels and access to the software repositories of the base system.
LxPup combines all the significant advantages of Puppy Linux - small iso size, extensive hardware support, wide range of applications built-in, live cd and frugal installs, friendly supportive user forum etc etc, with the lightweight but modern LXDE desktop environment.

It can be frustrating to manually reinstall Firefox with all its extensions, themes, personas and other add-ons. Even for those administrators who need to deploy Firefox on hundreds of network computers will find it a cumbersome task to do it manually. To assist you in building a silent Firefox installer with all of the settings preset, here is FFaM, aka Firefox Addon Maker.


This is an application written in C# that will create a silent installer. The installer can be created in Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7, 32-bit or 64-bit. The installers can be installed in Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7, 32-bit or 64-bit. You can create an installer with all of your settings intact, an installer with no modifications. Or, anything in between. You can create an installer from one of the three versions posted by Mozilla, the Current version, the Previous version and the Beta version.*NOTE*

"Acrylic is a local DNS proxy for Windows which improves the performance of your computer by caching the responses coming from your DNS servers and helps you fight unwanted ads through the use of a custom HOSTS file (optimized for handling hundreds of thousands of domain names) with support for wildcards and regular expressions.

When you browse a web page a portion of the loading time is dedicated to name resolution while the rest is dedicated to the transfer of the web page contents. What Acrylic does is to reduce the time dedicated to name resolution for frequently visited addresses closest to zero possible. Furthermore Acrylic's sliding expiration caching mechanism and DNS silent updates are able to improve the browsing experience independently of the browser.

With Acrylic you can also gracefully overcome downtimes of your DNS servers without disrupting your work, because in that case you will at least be able to connect to your favourite websites and to your email server.Acrylic is a local DNS proxy for Windows which improves the performance of your computer by caching the responses coming from your DNS servers and helps you fight unwanted ads through the use of a custom HOSTS file (optimized for handling hundreds of thousands of domain names) with support for wildcards and regular expressions.

Nitrux emphasizes the use of AppImages to manage end-user software. Nitrux also does not use systemD as its init system; instead, it uses OpenRC.

Nitrux includes a suite of convergent applications called Maui Apps. We use MauiKit, our convergent, cross-platform UI framework, to create these applications. Both MauiKit and the Maui Apps are entirely free and open-source software.

In addition to this, we include a curated selection of free and open-source software by default; we don’t add proprietary software. And for those looking for a 100% free (as in freedom) operating system, the optional Linux Libre kernel is available to install.
