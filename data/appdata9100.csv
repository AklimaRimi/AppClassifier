"Cohesive zone model (CZM) is a powerful method to study many cracking phenomena. Cohesive interface elements constitute a simple to implement yet valuable tool to implement CZM. This project provides a simple C++ code that reads a finite element mesh, modify it and generate cohesive interface elements where needed. It can read Gmsh (http://geuz.org/gmsh/) or ABAQUS input files and write the mesh to any format such as ABAQUS and jive (http://www.dynaflow.com/en_GB/jive.html). The code was written by VP Nguyen (google scholar link: http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jCqqCAoAAAAJ&hl=en) when he was at TU Delft and the algorithm is described in the article

VP Nguyen, ""An open source program to generate zero-thickness cohesive interface elements"", Advances in Engineering Software, 2014(74), 27--39.

The code was compiled in Ubuntu/Mac OS (a gnu makefile is provided) and Windows (Microsoft Visual Studio). You have to install the library Boost (http://www.boost.org) first.Cohesive zone model (CZM) is a powerful method to study many cracking phenomena.

"This project includes several Python and bash scripts designed to connect Geiger Muller counters to report their results to RadMon.org. Soon the script will also feature local logging, graphing and alerting.

Just because the Cold War is ""over"" does not mean that there is no more threat of a radiological attack. In fact, the U.S. Homeland Security Council lists the ""Detonation of a 10 Megaton Improvised Nuclear Device"" as ""Scenario #1"" among the top 15 threats to American security. Or, if you do not believe that a nuclear bomb is likely, what about all the Chernobyl-style Soviet-era nuclear power stations still in service? The point is: let us work together as free people to jointly report and track radiation levels around the globe. Information is power--and more importantly, information can save lives.

"The primary driver of speciation may result from hybridization instead of the accumulation of mutations. The accumulation of mutations may instead be responsible for a ""maturation"" which may have real physical meaning rather than being an amorphous concept.

Scientists such as Donald Williamson and Lynn Margulis have suggested similar ideas but perhaps not going as far as this project assumes.

This software converted the Catalogue of Life, catalogueoflife.org, into a gedcom format. It no longer works due to the Catalogue's database format change.

This present project extends the gedcom format for use in systematics or species categorization. All named taxonomic levels are assumed to have originally been individual species and the software/database outputs all species as female until hybridization events can be added manually.

This tool is used to develop the data at http://genealogyoflife.com. It converted the data from 1.2 million species to over 2 million gedcom females.The primary driver of speciation may result from hybridization instead of the accumulation of mutations.
