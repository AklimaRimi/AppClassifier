"The sandbox libraries (libsandbox & pysandbox) are an open-source suite of software components for C/C++ and Python developers to create automated profiling tools and watchdog programs. The API's are designed for executing and instrumenting simple (single process) tasks, featuring policy-based behavioral auditing, resource quota, and statistics collecting.

The sandbox libraries were originally designed and utilized as the core security module of a full-fledged online judge system for ACM/ICPC training. They have since then evolved into a general-purpose tool for binary program testing, profiling, and security restriction. The sandbox libraries are currently maintained by the OpenJudge Alliance (http://openjudge.net/) as a standalone, open-source project to facilitate various assignment grading solutions for IT/CS education.
