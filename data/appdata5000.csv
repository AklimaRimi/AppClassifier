WDTVHubGen2 is a batch processor for getting metadata and thumbs for a wdtv live hub. processes both movies and tv shows, supports many languages and uses themoviedb.org and thetvdb.com.

This program also does a lot of parsing to make the files easier to lookup and even aggressively looks up filenames where there are download tags and such.

Simply download the latest build und unzip.

It will probably need .Net Framework 4.0 or 4.5, wich is standard with Win10.

Known bugs at this time :
-Posters area not fully functionnal
-File in use when trying to save several times

"THTMLdom is a (Delphi) class with functions to read a HTML source file and dissect it into a tree of THTMLelement. The attributes of the HTML tags are stored in the elements. Functions are provided to select elements on the basis of the attribute values or tag names. The structure of the tree can be shown and it can be rendered as plain text.
The source is plain Delphi pascal, requiring a version that supports Tdictionary. There is no dependency on 3rd party units.
The file to be parsed must have valid HTML4/5 tags. It is not necessary that the HTML is ‘correct’ in the sense that end tags may be wrongly placed or be absent altogether. The speed of processing (reading+parsing) is formidable: 15-40 msec per Mbyte or around 1 msec per 1000 HTML tags.THTMLdom is a (Delphi) class with functions to read a HTML source file and dissect it into a tree of THTMLelement.

The framework parses textual JSON document to nodes tree that represents JSON entity: object, array or value of primitive type. Generated tree allows to modify values of nodes and/or structure of the given JSON document. Representation of JSON object as a nodes tree allows implement an operations such as path query and transformations (like XPATH and XSLT for XML).Json Node Tree framework is provisioning of transformation operations for JSON documents similar XML XPATH and XSLT.

"CSV Comparator is a tool for comparing files which contain CSV-Data. It was created for performance engineers to be able to have a easy way to compare data from two testruns and be able to automate the comparing process of various files with scripts.
There is a command line tool as well as a user interface.

In case you need to compare .xml-Files you can convert them to .csv-Files with my other project CSV Transformer.

The advantages by using CSV as input and output are the following:
- Many applications allow an export of its data to CSV or Excel(were it could be saved to CSV)
- It is possible to pre- and postprocess the data, e.g removing version numbers before comparing
- It is easy to create CSV data from logfiles and other resources by using unix tools like sed or awk
- CSV can be loaded into other applications, especially Excel, were it can be formatted by macros for analyzing.CSV Comparator is a tool for comparing files which contain CSV-Data.

"MorganaXProc is a full implementation of XProc: An XML Pipeline Language (W3C Recommendation 11 May 2010) written in Java, supporting all required and optional steps, the steps proposed on EXProc.org and also the document templating steps ""p:in-scope-names"" and ""p:template"".
XPath 2.0 or XPath 3.0 is used as expression language.
XSLT and XQuery are supported out of the box, while a flexible connector mechanism also allows to employ your favorite XSLT and XQuery processors.

The current version is 1.0.x.

"P.S. Dear friends. Repository migration to https://github.com/ascrus/getl . You can download jar file from this site or maven.

GETL - based package in Groovy, which automates the work of loading and transforming data. His name is an acronym for «Groovy ETL».

GETL is a set of libraries of pre-built classes and objects that can be used to solve problems unpacking, transform and load data into programs written in Groovy, or Java, as well as from any software that supports the work with Java classes.

GETL taken into account when developing ideas and following requirements:
1. The simpler the class hierarchy, the easier solution;
2. The data structures tend to change over time, or not be known in advance, working with them must be maintained;
3. All routine work ETL should be automated wherever possible;
4. Compiling the code on the fly bail speed and reserve for the optimization;
5. Sophisticated class hierarchy guarantee easy connection of other open source solutions.P.S. Dear friends. Repository migration to https://github.com/ascrus/getl . You can download jar file from this site or maven.
