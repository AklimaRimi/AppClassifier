Distributed Proofreaders is a web application intended to ease the process of converting public domain books and other printed materials into e-texts. The main site is at http://www.pgdp.net

By breaking the work into individual pages, many proofreaders can be working on the same book at the same time. This significantly speeds up the proofreading/E-Text creation process.

When a proofer elects to proofread a page for a particular project, the text and image file are displayed on a single webpage. This allows the text file to be easily reviewed and compared to the image file, thus assisting the proofreading of the text file. The edited text is then submitted back to the site via the same webpage that it was edited on.

Once all pages for a particular book have been processed, a concatenated text file is made available for final clean-up and submitted to a Project Gutenberg site.Project has moved to https://github.com/DistributedProofreaders/dproofreaders
