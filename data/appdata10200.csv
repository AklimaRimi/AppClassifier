"exGENT version 230109/230121 Linux Live System is - as the name suggest - based on Gentoo Linux. The best thing with exGENT is the premier auto detection of hardware and the ability to relatively easy install the system to hard drive during a live session. (Calamares Installer). LXQt 1.2/LXDE is used as Desktop environments. Used kernels: 5.15.80/6.1.7.

INSTALLATION
The system can easily be installed to hard drive and/or a USB flash drive. The installation takes 5 - 20 min. (Depending on computer type).

ROLLING DISTRIBUTION
Gentoo/exGENT is a ""rolling"" distribution, which means that you can always get the latest software without reinstalling. Upgrade the system every month or so...

GO FOR IT!
You'll run exGENT super fast in RAM. The launch from the DVD becomes a little slow, but then... A wonderful way to run Linux if you have enough RAM. You'll need at least 6 GB.
