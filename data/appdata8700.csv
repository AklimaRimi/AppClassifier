The ECG Logger project is a Wearable Cardio Monitor for Long-Term (up to 24h) ECG Data Acquisition and Analysis (aka Holter) with an ECG live (real-time) mode.

This project provides a very low-cost open-source ""Hardware and Software"" for a Cardiac Rhythmic Holter. The hardware has been made very simple and is based on an Arduino Nano micro-controller with boards for SD card mass-storage, instrumentation differential amplifier and RTC. It can help monitoring arrhythmia syndromes such as bradycardia, tachycardia, extra-systoles, pause or flutter.

WARNING:
In no case it can be use to replace a professional medical examination.

"K3DSurf (now MathMod) is a program to visualize and manipulate Mathematical models in three, four, five and six dimensions. K3DSurf supports Parametric equations and Isosurfaces.
******
Welcome to the realm of complex numbers!
Change-log for MathMod-11.1 (16/06/2021)
1) Support of graphing functions with complex numbers Z=u+iv in 3D and 4D spaces (demo scripts: ""Complex3D_xx"" and ""Complex4D_Saddle"")
2) Added support for HSV (hue, saturation, brightness) coloring model (script: ""Complex_Domain_Coloring"")
3) Texture definitions (RGB and HSV) for parametric surfaces can now be expressed as functions of complex numbers
4) Added a software implementation for the OpenGL variable gl_FrontFacing (fixed an issue with GPU drivers on MacOSX Catalina).
The activation of this patch is available from mathmodconfig.js (""OpenGlConfig""-->""GL_FrontFacingSupport""=false)
or the GUI(""Appearance""-->""OpenGL Front Surface Support"")
5) Bug-fixes, code optimization and documentation update.K3DSurf (now MathMod) is a program to visualize and manipulate Mathematical models in three, four, five and six dimensions. K3DSurf supports Parametric equations and Isosurfaces.
