"ABOUT
RaspEX Build 220228 is a full Linux Desktop system with LXDE and many other useful programs pre-installed. Firefox and Chromium are used as Web Browsers and Synaptic as Package Manager. You can use Synaptic to install any extra packages you may need. RaspEX uses Ubuntu's 22.04 LTS software repositories so you can install thousands of extra packages if you want.

NEWS 220228
This RaspEX Rpi4 uses kernel 5.15.24-exton-v7l+/5.15.24-exton-v7+ and Ubuntu 22.04 ""Jammy Jellyfish"" repositories.

RaspEX Build 210109 for Pi 4, 3 B, B+ and 2 has OpenCPN 5.2.4 pre-installed.

WHY SHALL I USE RaspEX?
Eight Operating Systems are recommended by Raspberrypi.org. Among them Raspbian. RaspEX is faster, more useful and more fun to use. (In my opinion). One member at raspex.exton.se thought that running RaspEX was like running Raspberry on “steroids“. If you run Build 220228 on a Raspberry Pi 4 it's even faster.

Based on upcoming Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Debian ""Sid"" and Linaro.ABOUT
