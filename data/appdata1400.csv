Notepad++ offers a wide range of features, such as autosaving, line bookmarking, simultaneous editing, tabbed document interface, and many more features. Over 140 plugins are also available to use in the default program.

Notepad++ takes advantage of higher execution speed and smaller program size by using Win32 API and STL. The ability to optimize efficiency without sacrificing user-friendliness results in an environment-friendly technology that reduces carbon dioxide emissions. Ultimately, the reduction in power consumption is much better for the environment while still being a viable option for businesses.
