"Luminance HDR is a complete suite for HDR imaging workflow. It provides a wide range of functionalities, during both the fusion stage and the tonemapping stage. Its graphical user interface, based on Qt5, runs on a variety of platforms, such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X 10.9 and later and several Unix flavors (Linux, FreeBSD and others).

Input images can be supplied in multiple formats, from JPEG to RAW files. In the same way, output can be saved in many different formats as well, from JPEG to TIFF (both 8 bit and 16 bit per channel), enabling all the power of your post processing tools.Luminance HDR is a complete suite for HDR imaging workflow.

Drop video files in the mixing workspace and place them in a circular area to change their opacity ; if you selects two videos, moving them together performs a fading transition.
