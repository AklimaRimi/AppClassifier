BioPAX supports data exchange between pathway data groups and thus reduces the complexity of interchange between data formats by providing an accepted standard format for pathway data. By offering a standard, with well-defined semantics for pathway representation, BioPAX allows pathway databases and software to interact more efficiently. In addition, BioPAX enables the development of pathway visualization from databases and facilitates analysis of experimentally generated data through combination with prior knowledge. The BioPAX effort is coordinated closely with that of other pathway related standards initiatives namely; PSI-MI, SBML, CellML, and SBGN in order to deliver a compatible standard in the areas where they overlap.BioPAX is a standard language for integration, exchange, visualization and analysis of biological pathway data.

The equipment and laboratory setup needed for delivering this education are expensive and difficult to assemble due to the large variety of the type of experiments that are desirable to cover. For a basic education one needs to have gamma, beta, alpha and neutron sources, at least one detector to detect each type of radiation and other supplemental instrumentation to perform experiments. Although the radiation exposure due to these radioactive sources in an education laboratory is low, shielding and a private secured place is needed. Nearly two hundred thousand dollars is needed to construct such a basic laboratory described as above.

"We are proud to introduce version 4 of CAMPARI. Maintaining the philosophy introduced with V3 to speed up (almost) everything with the help of OpenMP (threads parallelism), we have added a number of new algorithms from the recent literature, most notably an entire module dealing with small molecules of arbitrary chemistry for applications in computational docking and drug design. Naturally, CAMPARI continues to provide the reference implementation of the ABSINTH force field paradigm and implicit solvation model.

CAMPARI is a joint package for performing and analyzing molecular simulations, in particular of systems of biological relevance. It focuses on a wide availability of algorithms for (advanced) sampling and is capable of combining Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics in seamless fashion. CAMPARI offers the user a very high level of control over all implemented features.
