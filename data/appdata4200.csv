This Arduino Simulator is different than all the other simulators. If you don’t have components like sensors, Leds..., then this program will simulate the components for you. You need a real Arduino board for testing your programs with your computer.

You can drag and drop the components in a worksheet and you can draw everything you want around it. It is also possible to load a background into the worksheet. You can also combine simulated inputs/outputs from the pc and real Arduino IO, now you have made a little HMI (Human Machine Interface).

It's also possible to simulate through TCP WiFi-Ethernet connection.

This Arduino Simulator is different than all the other simulators. If you don’t have components like sensors, Leds..., then this program will simulate the components for you. You need a real Arduino board for testing your programs with your computer.

You can drag and drop the components in a worksheet and you can draw everything you want around it. It is also possible to load a background into the worksheet. You can also combine simulated inputs/outputs from the pc and real Arduino IO, now you have made a little HMI (Human Machine Interface).

Kannolo does not include software that requires GTK+ (Firefox, Anaconda, firewall-config, ABRT), featuring KDE or Qt software (QupZilla, Calamares, UFW-KDE, DrKonqi) instead. SELinux is disabled by default because there is no Qt/KDE troubleshooting application for it. GTK+ and GTK+ applications are available from the upstream distribution’s online repositories, enabled by default.

Another difference is that the upstream distribution's live image is a pure installable live image that does not allow any kind of package selection during installation, whereas Kannolo is a hybrid live and netinstall image, powered by the Calamares netinstall module, which offers a selection of recommended and optional packages to install from the Internet during the installation process.

For now, we have packages for Debian , Ubuntu and compatible, but with the code , all written in zenity , shell script , it is very easy to port it to any Linux distribution . The goal is to provide an environment that is a very lightweight option for consecrated Unity , Gnome , KDE or XFCE and LXDE and has excellent usability .

How we use the ROX desktop, as a basis , the user will have access to advanced features of the Drag'n Drop . Basically , you can drag applications , documents and folders to the panel , desktop and elsewhere . This is a characteristic of ROX .

"Makes easier to type UNICODE, into Geany.

http://www.geany.org/

For example, after you have typed 2203, into Geany, press Ctrl+Right Alt+y, and 2203 is replaced with ∃.

To replace at most 3 hex digits left of cursor, press Ctrl+Right Alt+o. This makes possible typing modifiers, to letter e, that would otherwise be considered a hex digit. For example, type e301, and next press Ctrl+Right Alt+o, and e301 is replaced with é.

Last you may type things like 1d4ae, and press Ctrl+Alt+e, and 1d4ae is replaced by 𝒮. Codepoints of 5 hex digits are less frequently used than those of 4, so they get their own key binding.

The plugin may be used with Geany versions 0.21, …, 1.32.Makes easier to type UNICODE, into Geany.
