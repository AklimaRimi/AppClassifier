"Writes and reads complete drive images to/from SD drives.

Running on Windows 7 and above, requires .NET Framework 4.5

Because Win32DiskImager didn't work on my computers (Win7 + Win8), I decided to write my own tool using VS2013 and .Net 4.5.

Currently it can read and write Images from/to SD drives or other via USB attached storage. Basic formatting functionality is also included.

"The main focus is to have a small, updated and stable distribution that is fully compatible with official Raspbian image, without GUI and unneeded tools.
So this image is perfect for embedded projects, or wherever you need to use all RPi resources for your specific tasks.
The main advantage is that MINIBIAN has a very small footprint, boots in some seconds and uses just few of precious RPi RAM.
Unlike other similar projects, MINIBIAN has not been obtained purging unneeded packages from original image, neither recompiling the source code: it’s just a customized Raspbian installation obtained from the same repository used for official RPi image.
So kernel and binary files are exactely the same you will find on standard image, with the difference that MINIBIAN fit on 1GB SD Card, is fastest, and updated more often.The main focus is to have a small, updated and stable distribution that is fully compatible with official Raspbian image, without GUI and unneeded tools.

In these cases, Windows' sleep functionality is suspended and won't kick in once the video has finished.

The solution for many is to use a sleep timer to send the computer to sleep after the estimated amount of time of the video. But you need to remember to do this every time. Sleep# handles this automatically:

Sleep# sends your computer to sleep after the playback of fullscreen video, providing Windows has been idle for a predefined amount of time.

There is a grace period at the end of the fullscreen video before sending your computer to sleep, allowing you to interrupt the process should you still be awake.

"IMPORTANT!!!
Since this is new software, your web browser, operating system or even possibly antivirus software may report security alerts against this tool. Please ignore that messages until this tool gets widely spread.

This program is highly inspired by Win32 Disk Imager and sort of copies it's function.

However, I've added some features, like verification of readed/writed image file and the most important is on the fly support for zipped images.

Another features worth mentioning are simultaneous write to multiple devices at one time or wiping of device filesystem and partitions.

I would be happy to hear your feedback and I'm ready to listen to your suggestions. Feel free to request new features, if I found them interesting I will definitely implement them.

Requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 (download here: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=671729 )
Supports Windows 7 and newer.
If you need older Windows support, use Win32 Disk Imager.

Please write a review.IMPORTANT!!!

"TurboVNC is a high-performance, enterprise-quality version of VNC based on TightVNC, TigerVNC, and X.org. It contains a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned for maximum performance and compression with 3D applications (VirtualGL), video, and other image-intensive workloads. TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance. TurboVNC's high-speed encoding methods have been adopted by TigerVNC and libvncserver, and TurboVNC is also compatible with any other TightVNC derivative.

TurboVNC forked from TightVNC in 2004 and still covers all of the TightVNC 1.3.x features, but TurboVNC contains numerous feature enhancements and bug fixes relative to TightVNC, and it compresses 3D and video workloads much better than TightVNC while using generally only 5-20% of the CPU time of the latter. Using non-default settings, TurboVNC can also be made to compress 2D workloads as ""tightly"" as TightVNC.TurboVNC is a high-performance, enterprise-quality version of VNC based on TightVNC, TigerVNC, and X.org.
