The Writer's Workbench is a single tool that incorporates the various tool types that many writers use to create an Integrated Writing Environment (IWE). It provides these various tools without binding a writer to a single structure or vision for constructing a story and seeks to enable the creative process by providing immediate access to any story artifact in the tool without the obtrusiveness of having many windows opened at the same time.The Writer's Workbench is a single tool that incorporates the various tool types that many writers use to create an Integrated Writing Environment (IWE).

"DateCalculator is a Java application that performs three kinds of calculation on calendar dates:

* Increment
Add a number of days to a date or subtract a number of days from a date (eg, find the date 100 days after today).

* Difference
Calculate the number of days between two dates (eg, find the number of days from the start of next week to the end of the year).

* Interval
Generate a sequence of dates with a given number of days between each successive pair of dates (eg, make a list of all the Saturdays in the next four years).

The application uses the Gregorian calendar for all dates, and it accepts input dates between the years 1600 AD (CE) and 3999 AD (CE). Dates output by DateCalculator are displayed in user-defined formats. In those formats, the names of days and months may be obtained from a Java locale (a language, or a language and a country) or they may be user-defined.DateCalculator is a Java application that performs three kinds of calculation on calendar dates:

"Note helper is a new kind of application—not a new genre, but a new idea.
Sometimes, people overlook simple problems, say “hay, there's a work around”, but that's not good enough; there needs to be a quick, simple way to solve the problem. Note helper aims to bridge the gap. While possibly not a complete solution [only developer integration can do that], it is an easier solution to the problem.
Musical notation is chaotic—at first glance there isn't a pattern [there is, though]--but why memorise seven values, then work out averages, or multiply when you can get a computer to do it for you?
Note helper has one purpose, to do this. It's reason for being is to tell you what the frequency value of notes is [plus or minus 0.5hz]. And while it's feature set is limited, we all dislike bloatware, don't we?

"I don't know how many times I've searched the web for a win32 version of fuser. It is a great utility used in Unix/Linux for figuring out what process(es) have a file open (among other stuff).

Many would ask, ""why not use handle.exe from SysInternals?""

While being a truly excellent utility (as all of SysInternals stuff is), it falls short -- at least for me -- for a couple of reasons:

1) It does filename pattern matching. I need it to do exact file matches with partial input. For example, when I'm in the C:\TMP directory, and I'm checking on a file named 'out.dat', I want it to see if the file C:\TMP\OUT.DAT is being used without having to type the full path in. I think even if you type in the full path for handle.exe, it will still do pattern matching.

2) Handle.exe seems to always exit 0. For scripting purposes, I need it to exit 1 if the file is not being used, but 0 if it is.
