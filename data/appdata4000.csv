"I was tired of always having to start a new instance of notepad to take a note of something during my busy work day. All the other note applications seem very bulky and didn't really work with the fast pace that I work at.

So... I made TotesNotes!.

Click the little tray icon and up pops a note pad to pop text into. There are even a few tabs if you want to seperate them a little bit.

* Requires .NET 4.5

Note : If you dont see the icon in your tray, just drag it next to your clock. It should stay there for future use.
