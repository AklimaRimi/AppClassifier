"Originally developed by Google for internal use, TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.

Available across all common operating systems (desktop, server and mobile), TensorFlow provides stable APIs for Python and C as well as APIs that are not guaranteed to be backwards compatible or are 3rd party for a variety of other languages. The platform can be easily deployed on multiple CPUs, GPUs and Google's proprietary chip, the tensor processing unit (TPU).

TensorFlow expresses its computations as dataflow graphs, with each node in the graph representing an operation. Nodes take tensors—multidimensional arrays—as input and produce tensors as output. The framework allows for these algorithms to be run in C++ for better performance, while the multiple levels of APIs let the user determine how high or low they wish the level of abstraction to be in the models produced.

Tensorflow can also be used for research and production with TensorFlow Extended.Originally developed by Google for internal use, TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.

"The Package is installable in GNU Octave and offers OpenCL support for parallelization of numerical computations. It is most effective for computations which are based on large vectors or n-dimensional arrays of numbers, and mostly (but not limited to) identical element-wise operations. The user can select which available OpenCL hardware and drivers are to be used.

The Package offers new numeric data types with many built-in operations (e.g., overloaded operators). It is flexibly extendible by user-written OpenCL C programs. The Package does not, by itself, provide parallelization of higher numerical methods (like BLAS or LAPACK).

The Package is also available from the corresponding Octave Forge webpage https://octave.sourceforge.io/ocl/index.html.

Java program that simulates a vessel moving on the face of the earth. Assuming you have all
the prerequisites installed you can run the program either directly from eclipse or just
download the JAR file and go ""java -jar <name_of_jar_file.jar>""

Tell your navigation software/whatever to connect to port 2222 of your machine. NMEA 0183 sentences
are sent out from the simulation on port 2222.

In the GUI slide up the speed slider (vertical) to start moving and steer using the steering

"Xschem is a schematic capture program, it allows to create a hierarchical representation of circuits with a top down approach . By focusing on interconnections, hierarchy and properties a complex system (IC) can be described in terms of simpler building blocks. A VHDL, Verilog or Spice netlist can be generated from the drawn schematic, allowing the simulation of the circuit. Key feature of the program is its drawing engine written in C and using directly the Xlib drawing primitives; this gives top speed performance, even on very big circuits. I have succesfully managed to simulate complete VLSI projects with this tool, both digital (Verilog / VHDL) and analog (Spice).
Schematics can be printed in SVG, PNG, PDF, formats. XSCHEM runs on Linux or other Unix-likes with Xorg server and on Windows with the Cygwin layer and required tools installed.

Online Signature Verification technology requires primarily a digitizing tablet and a special pen connected to the USB port of a computer. An individual can sign on the digitizing tablet using the special pen regardless of his signature size and position. The signature is characterized as pen-strokes consisting x-y coordinates and pressure with the data being stored in a signature database. Dynamic time warping (DTW) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) is used to get results where the system accepts 2% of forged signatures and rejects 5% of true signaturesOnline Signature Verification technology requires primarily a digitizing tablet and a special pen connected to the USB port of a computer.

"The Ciiva Electronic Component REST API provides programmatic access to the Ciiva Cloud Database. This is the same database which is used to power the Ciiva Electronic Component Search Engine at http://ciiva.com. It is also the same database which is integrated with the Ciiva Bill of Materials Management System (BMMS) at http://ciiva.com/bill-of-materials-software.

The API can be used with a wide variety of different programming languages. It allows the user to query the Ciiva Cloud Database for component information in a variety of ways, including searching via description or part number.

Queries to the Ciiva API return one or more data objects which contain information on manufacturer and supplier components, such as lifecycle, compliance, pricing, availability, substitutes/alternatives, datasheets, and more.The Ciiva Electronic Component REST API provides programmatic access to the Ciiva Cloud Database.

"This software is a very simple network analyzer.

When you click the start button, it will send a configurable stream of UDP packets to a host. (The receiving host is then required to echo all the packets back to the sender, which can be easily done via iptables rule under linux). Once the eched packets arrives back to the sender, the analyzer will calculate all the related statistics like, packet loss, jitter throughput etc...

NOTE: in order to receive the echo packets you must configure the receiving host to echo the incoming packets.
In the next release i will provide another java application that just echo on an UDP port.This software is a very simple network analyzer.

"Multi-categorization Recommendation Adjusting (MRA) is to optimize the results of recommendation based on traditional(basic) recommendation models, through introducing objective category information and taking use of the feature that users always get the habits of preferring certain categories. Besides this, there are two advantages of this improved model: 1) it can be easily applied to any kind of existing recommendation models. And 2) a controller is set in this improved model to provide controllable adjustment range, which thereby makes it possible to provide optional modes of recommendation aiming different kinds of users.Multi-categorization Recommendation Adjusting (MRA) is to optimize the results of recommendation based on traditional(basic) recommendation models, through introducing objective category information and taking use of the feature that users always get the habits of preferring certain categories.

"Strings edit is a library that provides I/O facilities for integers, floating-point numbers, Roman numerals, and strings. Both input and output subroutines support string pointers for consequent stream processing. The output can be aligned in a fixed size field with padding. Numeric input can be checked against expected values range to be either saturated or to raise an exception. For floating-point output either relative or absolute output precision can be specified. UTF-8 encoded strings are supported, including wildcard pattern matching, sets and maps of code points, upper/lowercase, and other Unicode categorizations.Strings edit is a library that provides I/O facilities for integers, floating-point numbers, Roman numerals, and strings.

"The goal of the project is the realization of a modular firmware that allows to control a CNC machine with different utensils. For instance, a CNC with a drill, with few changes can become a plotter with a pen or cutting machine to cut cardboard or stickers. In order to do that, we want project a CNC router with a mechanism that allows a fast utensil change and a controlling firmware which can use different utensils changing some configuration parameters.The goal of the project is the realization of a modular firmware that allows to control a CNC machine with different utensils.

"Adele was developed to simplify the daily work with data. Use it as a swiss knife to fill the gap between your work with spreadsheet application like MS Excel and enterprise servers like SAP ERP.

Specialized tools like Rapid Miner, KNIME or similiary stuff should not be replaced. But Adele is designed for business people working with spreadsheet applications to analyse their data.

There are many technical concepts in an easier way included. For example realtime OLAP, transformations, charts, analysis tools,... Connectors (e.g. JDBC, SAP ABAP, OData) can be used to pre-analyse the data and extract it without saving the data as text files. A plugin concept for enhancements are available.

Enjoy! Its free for commercial use too. Adele runs without installation from USB stick for Windows, Linux and MacOSX.

Last added changes:
- data science tools (V1, IQR)
- export to remote and desktop databases (mysql,sqlite, ms access)
- internet features for emails and domainsAdele was developed to simplify the daily work with data. Use it as a swiss knife to fill the gap between your work with spreadsheet application like MS Excel and enterprise servers like SAP ERP.
