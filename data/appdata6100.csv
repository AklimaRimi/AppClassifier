Even for those administrators who need to deploy Firefox on hundreds of network computers will find it a cumbersome task to do it manually. To assist you in building a silent Firefox installer with all of the settings preset, here is FFaM, aka Firefox Addon Maker.

"Acrylic is a local DNS proxy for Windows which improves the performance of your computer by caching the responses coming from your DNS servers and helps you fight unwanted ads through the use of a custom HOSTS file (optimized for handling hundreds of thousands of domain names) with support for wildcards and regular expressions.

When you browse a web page a portion of the loading time is dedicated to name resolution while the rest is dedicated to the transfer of the web page contents. What Acrylic does is to reduce the time dedicated to name resolution for frequently visited addresses closest to zero possible. Furthermore Acrylic's sliding expiration caching mechanism and DNS silent updates are able to improve the browsing experience independently of the browser.

With Acrylic you can also gracefully overcome downtimes of your DNS servers without disrupting your work, because in that case you will at least be able to connect to your favourite websites and to your email server.Acrylic is a local DNS proxy for Windows which improves the performance of your computer by caching the responses coming from your DNS servers and helps you fight unwanted ads through the use of a custom HOSTS file (optimized for handling hundreds of thousands of domain names) with support for wildcards and regular expressions.

After releasing a few updates, but far less than we wanted, we’ve made the decision to stop the OptimizeGoogle Project.

The code will remain GPL, perhaps another person or team is interested in picking this up.

For now, thank you for all your patience, feedback and support.
