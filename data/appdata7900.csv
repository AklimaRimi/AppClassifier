"The SOSETSUKEN Engine is a handy tool for generating corruption parameters for use with the Vinesauce ROM Corrupter. You simply feed it the end byte found by Auto End, the level of corruption, and the amount of sets you want to generate. Its only throttle is the speed of your PC and the space left on your hard drive. This thing is fast, simple and small. It even puts out how long it takes to generate the requested sets at the very bottom of ""params.txt"" (the output file).

"Smack HP Service Manager to keep it alive

This is a small utility written in AutoHotKey for Microsoft Windows, to keep the HP Service Manager client active so that network difficulties and extremely short inactivity timeouts don't keep logging a user out. This should work for any version of the Java client, on any version of Service Manager in any organization.

All this does is run in the system tray, wake up occasionally, and click a control on the Service Manager window to send activity.

If Service Manager is not running, this utility does nothing until Service Manager is discovered.

There is no installation, no registry entries - 100% portable, no configuration .ini files. Run the program and look for the icon in the system tray. Right click and a menu pops up with About, Help and other options.

Note: this is *not* intended to help circumvent corporate usage policies and impact concurrent licensed user counts. This was an academic exercise while learning Autohotkey.Smack HP Service Manager to keep it alive
