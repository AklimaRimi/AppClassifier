"QP real-time embedded frameworks (RTEFs) provide lightweight, modern event-driven architecture based on active objects (actors) and hierarchical state machines. The matching QM model-based design tool and other host-based tools complement the QP frameworks by supporting graphical modeling, code generation, software tracing and unit testing for event-driven embedded software. Visit https://www.state-machine.com for more information.

The QP RTEFs can run on bare-metal single-chip microcontrollers, completely replacing a traditional RTOS. The frameworks contain a selection of built-in real-time kernels (RTOS kernels), such as the cooperative QV kernel, the preemptive non-blocking QK kernel, and the unique preemptive, dual-mode (blocking/non-blocking) QXK kernel. Native QP ports and ready-to-use examples are provided for ARM Cortex-M (M0/M0+/M3/M4F/M7) as well as other CPUs.

The QP RTEFs can also work with many traditional RTOSes and desktop OSes, such as Linux and Windows.QP real-time embedded frameworks (RTEFs) provide lightweight, modern event-driven architecture based on active objects (actors) and hierarchical state machines.

NG-NetMS is precise, quick and efficient. It collects most complete information about the network inventory, topology, map of IPv4 addresses quickly and with minimum hassle.
Most important you will be able to collect, process and analyse Syslog events and SNMP alarms both in near-real-time and from the historical archives in a new way.

We successfully used NG-NetMS for delivery of network assessment services for our customers worldwide for many years. And now we want to share this unique and fully functional tool with community. It is not capped in terms of performance or number of nodes. The only limit is the hardware you deploy it on.

"Shorten your time of reading mega bytes of log files! DE 2016-01
Supporting Don HO's NotePad++ see http://notepad-plus-plus.org/
This sources are a dockable pattern search plugin for Notepad++ version 5.1 or later. With this plugin you can search for multiple patterns in any of the opened documents in NotePad++.
You may want to tune your search using all fancy tricks from NPP like regular expressions or escaped patterns and give each of the searches different colors. The result will be stored in a dockable window in same ordering as in the origin and a double click allows you to jump to the original position.

It is designed to treat log-files of typical size like 60MB. More features can be found in the help dialogue of the plugin. For generating the dll file I use a msdev compiler. If you like to port it to other OSs just let me know your changes and I'll incorporate it.

"Ventoy is an open source tool that lets you create a bootable USB drive for ISO files. Now there’s no need to format the disk again and again or to extract anything-- with Ventoy simply copy the ISO file to the USB drive and boot it. You can copy several ISO files at a time, and Ventoy will offer a boot menu where you can select them. It’s incredibly easy to use, with Legacy BIOS and UEFI being supported in the same way. There are over 260 ISO files tested, and a “Ventoy Compatible” concept has been introduced to help support any ISO file.Ventoy is an open source tool that lets you create a bootable USB drive for ISO files.

"Automated network based hard disk drives / storage devices erasure is server based software which installs on a central server. Server is connected to network switches and several PXE boot enabled workstations are attached to the network. As soon as the workstation is powered on, it boots off the network via the server and begins wiping all the attached hard disk drives. Once all the hard drives are wiped, data related to each hard disk is stored in the central server’s database. Read WIKI

"Denise is a cycle accurate and platform independant c64 / amiga (not yet) emulator.
My motivation for this project is understanding how it works and write clean and easy readable code.
New in Denise are fast loaders such as ProfDOS, PrologicDOS, DolphinDOS, ProSpeed 1571, Turbo Trans and 1571 floppy emulation.

Denise supports REU, GeoRam, EasyFlash, EasyFlash³, Gmod2, Retro Replay, Action Replay, Final Cartridge, Light Guns/Pens, GunStick, Mouse 1351, Mouse Neos, Paddles.
I have added runAhead, PAL and CRT emulation, FreeSync/G-Sync support, drag'n'drop and command line support.

Denise consists of 4 main modules.
""guikit"", ""driver"", ""emulation"" could be used in any other project. ""program"" links these modules together.
