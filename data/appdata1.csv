"Makes easier to type UNICODE, into Geany.

For example, after you have typed 2203, into Geany, press Ctrl+Right Alt+y, and 2203 is replaced with ∃.

To replace at most 3 hex digits left of cursor, press Ctrl+Right Alt+o. This makes possible typing modifiers, to letter e, that would otherwise be considered a hex digit. For example, type e301, and next press Ctrl+Right Alt+o, and e301 is replaced with é.

Last you may type things like 1d4ae, and press Ctrl+Alt+e, and 1d4ae is replaced by 𝒮. Codepoints of 5 hex digits are less frequently used than those of 4, so they get their own key binding.

Some major features: ability to handle big files (more than 1,000,000 lines and larger than 100MB), virtually no line size limit (2GB), columnar text selection and editing (like in UltraEdit), match searching for PL/SQL (BEGIN/EXCEPTION/END), regular expression in text searching and replacement, keymap customization (change custom.keymap).

"Open, edit .tmx files and set metadata to make them of better use in the most CAT programs.
Very light program written in C++, enables you to open (almost) any types of bilingual .tmx file, edit it, split and merge segments, shift the segments up and down as well as delete them. In-built QA checker helps to identify wrong alignments. The most important is the ability to add and edit metadata - proper ones as well as those embodied in opened tmx. Finally you can save the TMX in a well-structured form easily readable by most of the CAT tools.

BEFORE the INSTALLATION, download LF_aligner_4.05_win.zip from https://sourceforge.net/projects/aligner/ and have it in the same directory as the installer of this program. Installer will unzip, combine and install these two programs.

DOCX files are actually zipped collections of mostly XML files. The main text in docx files is found in document.xml file in the collection. Corrupt DOCX Salvager uses 7Zip, an unzipper that sometimes unzips partially corrupt document.xml files despite reporting an error.

XML as a format is unforgiving of data corruption but Corrupt DOCX Salvager uses a Perl routine used to extract the text from the document.xml file which doesn't care about well-formed XML, a recovery stumbling block for Microsoft Word.

"Zenburn for Emacs is a direct port of the popular Zenburn theme for vim, developed by Jani Nurminen. It's my personal belief (and that of its many users I presume) that it's one of the best low-contrast color themes out there and that it is exceptionally easy on the eyes. This theme uses the ""new"" (it used to be new several years ago when I created this package) built-in theming support available starting with Emacs 24.1. You can support the development of Zenburn for Emacs via GitHub Sponsors, ko-fi, PayPal and Patreon. Zenburn for Emacs is already bundled into Emacs Prelude. If you're a Prelude user - you're probably already using Zenburn, since it's Prelude's default color theme. You can load Zenburn at any time by M-x load-theme zenburn.

The API considered unstable until 1.0 release is out. It is tested against Java, Python, Ruby, Elixir and LLDB (C/C++/Objective-C/Swift). The main entry points are dap-debug and dap-debug-edit-template. The first one asks for a registered debug template and starts the configuration using the default values for that particular configuration. The latter creates a debug template which could be customized before running. dap-debug-edit-template will prepare a template declaration inside a temporary buffer.

"This package lets you “supercharge” your Org daily/weekly agenda. The idea is to group items into sections, rather than having them all in one big list. Now you can sort-of do this already with custom agenda commands, but when you do that, you lose the daily/weekly aspect of the agenda: items are no longer shown based on deadline/scheduled timestamps, but are shown no-matter-what. So this package filters the results from org-agenda-finalize-entries, which runs just before items are inserted into agenda views. It runs them through a set of filters that separate them into groups. Then the groups are inserted into the agenda buffer, and any remaining items are inserted at the end. Empty groups are not displayed. The end result is your standard daily/weekly agenda, but arranged into groups defined by you. You might put items with certain tags in one group, habits in another group, items with certain todo keywords in another, and items with certain priorities in another.This package lets you “supercharge” your Org daily/weekly agenda.

"Dumb Jump is an Emacs ""jump to definition"" package with support for 50+ programming languages that favors ""just working"". This means minimal -- and ideally zero-configuration with absolutely no stored indexes (TAGS) or persistent background processes. Dumb Jump requires at least GNU Emacs 24.3. Dumb Jump uses The Silver Searcher ag, ripgrep rg, or grep to find potential definitions of a function or variable under point. It uses a set of regular expressions based on the file extension, or major-mode, of the current buffer. The matches are run through a shared set of heuristic methods to find the best candidate to jump to. If it can't decide it will present the user with a list in a pop-menu, helm, or ivy (see dumb-jump-selector). For the currently supported languages it seems to do a good job of finding what you want. If you find a case where it does not work as expected do not hesitate to open an issue.

"Flycheck is a modern on-the-fly syntax-checking extension for GNU Emacs, intended as replacement for the older Flymake extension which is part of GNU Emacs. For a detailed comparison to Flymake see Flycheck versus Flymake. It uses various syntax checking and linting tools to automatically check the contents of buffers while you type, and reports warnings and errors directly in the buffer, or in an optional error list. Out of the box Flycheck supports over 40 different programming languages with more than 80 different syntax-checking tools, and comes with a simple interface to define new syntax checkers. Many 3rd party extensions provide new syntax checkers and other features like alternative error displays or mode line indicators. Flycheck needs GNU Emacs 24.3+, and works best on Unix systems. Windows users, please be aware that Flycheck does not support Windows officially, although it should mostly work fine on Windows.Flycheck is a modern on-the-fly syntax-checking extension for GNU Emacs, intended as replacement for the older Flymake extension which is part of GNU Emacs.

"Emacs incremental completion and selection narrowing framework. Helm is an Emacs framework for incremental completions and narrowing selections. It helps to rapidly complete file names, buffer names, or any other Emacs interactions requiring selecting an item from a list of possible choices. Helm is a fork of anything.el, which was originally written by Tamas Patrovic and can be considered to be its successor. Helm cleans the legacy code that is leaner, modular, and unchained from constraints of backward compatibility. Helm is an Emacs framework for incremental completions and narrowing selections.

"Projectile is a project interaction library for Emacs. Its goal is to provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without introducing external dependencies (when feasible). For instance - finding project files has a portable implementation written in pure Emacs Lisp without the use of GNU find (but for performance sake an indexing mechanism backed by external commands exists as well). This library provides easy project management and navigation. The concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing some special file (e.g. a VCS marker or a project descriptor file like pom.xml or Gemfile). Projectile will auto-detect pretty much every popular project type out of the box and you can easily extend it with additional project types. Projectile tries to be practical - portability is great, but if some external tools could speed up some task substantially and the tools are available, Projectile will leverage them.Projectile is a project interaction library for Emacs.

The visual block diagram interface offers a simple method for constructing, modifying and maintaining complex system models. The simulation engine provides fast and accurate solutions for linear, nonlinear, continuous time, discrete time, time varying and hybrid system designs. With JMCAD, users can quickly develop software or ""virtual"" prototypes of systems or processes to demonstrate their behavior prior to building physical prototypes.

The user builds his system model by selecting predefined blocks from a block library and simply wiring the blocks together. Each block of the diagram performs a function. Users can also create custom blocks in Java and add them to the JMCAD block library.

"MathMod is a portable interactive plotting and graphing program for Windows, Linux, MacOSX and many other platforms.
MathMod allows to plot 3D mathematical surfaces, described by implicit or parametric equations, and offers a very large database of model samples that can be generated with it. It's Free and Open Source.

Change-log for MathMod-11.1 (16/06/2021)
Welcome to the realm of complex numbers!

1) Support of graphing functions with complex numbers Z=u+iv in 3D and 4D spaces (demo scripts: ""Complex3D_xx"" and ""Complex4D_Saddle"")
2) Added support for HSV (hue, saturation, lightness) coloring model (script: ""Complex_Domain_Coloring"")
3) Texture definitions (RGB and HSV) for parametric surfaces can now be expressed as functions of complex numbers
4) Added a software implementation for the OpenGL variable gl_FrontFacing (fixed an issue with GPU drivers on MacOSX Catalina).

It is a VERY basic accounting software which most of the core functions are written within 11 hours. It is designed to mimic manual accounting(done by hand), therefore making it suitable for students and maybe lecturers.

"JSmol is the extension of the Java-based molecular visualization applet Jmol (jmol.sourceforge.net) as an HTML5 JavaScript-only web app. It can be used in conjunction with the Java applet to provide an alternative to Java when the platform does not support that (iPhone/iPad) or does not support applets (Android). Used in conjunction with the Jmol JavaScript Object (http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Jmol_Javascript_Object), JSmol seamlessly offers alternatives to Java on these non-Applet platforms.

JSmol can read all the files that Jmol reads. You can do all the scripting that Jmol does. You can create all the buttons and links and such that you are used to creating for Jmol. All of the rendering capability of the Jmol applet is there. JSmol has both a console and a popup menu.

"SpeeD ReaD helps you to read faster and more efficiently. By minimizing subvocalization and saccades, you can process and comprehend the text you read much faster than with normal reading.

First, subvocalization is the natural tendency for all of us to ""hear"" the words in our brains as we read. Think of it as reading out loud inside your head. But our minds do not need us to sound out the words we read - even inside our heads - in order to understand them. The words can be processed in a fraction of the time it takes us to sound them out. SpeeD ReaD forces you to simply comprehend words by sight.

Additionally, as we read blocks of text on a screen or in a book, our eyes tend to vacillate between rapid movements (saccades), as we move to the next word, and stops, as we focus on a word. By showing each word in the same area of the screen, SpeeD ReaD eliminates those unnecessary eye movements.

"Useful application easy to handle for the management of information on the process of teaching and learning that takes place in a class. The idea is that the teacher comes to class or anywhere else, insert a USB (Universal Serial Bus) in the personal computer and run the application.
When the application is launched the first thing we ask is a key that will be used to authenticate the user and to hide the information stored in database files using a cryptographic method. Once the user is authenticated, is shown a single window composite by tabs. Each tab allows us to perform a function associated with a time of teaching-learning process.
The application focuses on three main aspects: management grades, event management and management of the temporal distribution of programming.Useful application easy to handle for the management of information on the process of teaching and learning that takes place in a class.

"Origami Editor 3D is an advanced paper folding simulator. It uses a what-you-see-is-what-you-get interface and operates with a geometric abstraction of the Yoshizawa-Randlett system. Anything from a simple airplane to John Montroll's omega star can be folded in this editor.
Origami files created with the program preserve the entire folding process, and they can be exported as folding diagrams in PDF, animated GIF files, or even as standalone Java programs displaying the origami in a 3D viewer when opened.
The main purpose of this program is designing origami, but if you only want to learn how to make some origami figures, there is a set of built-in example files that can help you. Currently, there are 34 example figures available.
Please note that this project was created for fun and still is a work in progress. The Discussion forum is open for anyone who wants to report a bug or suggest a new feature.

The main purpose of this program is designing origami, but if you only want to learn how to make some origami figures, there is a set of built-in example files that can help you. Currently, there are 34 example figures available.
Please note that this project was created for fun and still is a work in progress. The Discussion forum is open for anyone who wants to report a bug or suggest a new feature.

"The MatrixUser project is moving to GitHub, the latest version can be obtained from https://leoliuf.github.io/MatrixUser/

Most of the medical images (e.g. CT, MRI, PET, etc.) comprises multiple frames which represent slices, phases, timing etc. from the same imaging object. Those images can be saved as multidimensional matrices in Matlab thanks to Matlab's powerful support of multidimensional data representation. However, within Matlab, most of image manipulation functions are limited or tailored for processing two-dimensional matrix. The MatrixUser is a software package which features functions designed and optimized specifically for manipulating multidimensional real or complex data matrix. MatrixUser provides a nice graphical environment for easily performing image analysis tasks including multidimensional image display, matrix (image stack) processing and rendering etc. MatrixUser is a great lightweight tool for users who are working in image processing field under Matlab.The MatrixUser project is moving to GitHub, the latest version can be obtained from https://leoliuf.github.io/MatrixUser/

This application was developed in the first place as an aide for benchmarking processes that required many different time intervals. User created playlists can be saved and imported, insuring you always have the right set of timers for the occasion.

Future features may include PowerPoint integration and actionable triggers (think cron job or scheduled task) that can fire after a given timer expires.

"The purpose of this project is to create and update a beginners guide to FreeBASIC. Over the years I have noticed that there was only three real ways to learn FreeBASIC. The FreeBASIC Documentation, the FreeBASIC Community Forum, and A old beginners guide written by Richard D. Clark and Ebben Feagan. Each of these sources are great, but they all assume some experience with a programming language.

This Project is taking Richard D. Clark's and Ebben Feagan's ""A Beginner's Guide to FreeBasic"" and is editing, updating, reorganizing, and simplifying this guide.

This is Terofal77, otherwise known as Jake and the producer of Sundog Resurrection. I have not updated this page for quite some time as our primary project website is www.SundogResurrectionProject.com. However, I wanted to make notification that the BETA RELEASE is about to drop.

Yup, at long last! Bruce ""hired"" me onto the Sundog Resurrection Team back in 2002 and through the years we soldiered on between periods of dormancy and turnover but always keeping the momentum forwards.

The Beta version is far more advanced than the Alpha version we released three years ago, and is a fairly polished game that meet's Bruce Webster's goal of recreating the original Sundog and adding additional features and creating a pocket galaxy with convincing verisimilitude.

"This is an attempt at a multiplayer client/server java rewrite of Microprose/Simtex's classic DOS turn based strategy game Master of Magic. Latest versions now require Java 17, however since a lot of folks have been having trouble setting this up, I am now providing 2 versions, one with a JRE included in the download, and one without. Beyond this, it should just be as simple as unzipping the file and running server.bat to get the server running locally, and client.bat to start up the client. See the readme for more details.

1.6 adds the last part of diplomacy, this was the last big feature to add. Releases from here on will likely be smaller features, bug fixes, mods and so on. 1.6.2 is a redesign of the spell book, with tabs to jump directly to each section.

I am most easily found at the MoM discord server at https://discord.gg/wFNQf36

Unfortunately, there isn't an alternative mechanism currently available to that would support the diceroller's functionality. This project is essentially on hiatus until a new API or other means of retrieving chat data from Skype becomes available.
