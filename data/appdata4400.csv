"""cosmogoniA Live"" is created with the intent to produce a version of ""Linux Live"" installable (for removable media: dvd, usb), *easy to use and complete of all kind of applications*, several graphical user interfaces, admin tools, even in multimedia.

The native version was Fedora Core based, now we have decided to change in favour of Ubuntu LTS. Today cosmogoniA Live include desktop manager like LXDE and GNOME.
Indeed, over the time KDE has become too heavy for a live version, so we have decided to leave KDE in favor of Gnome Desktop Shell and the light Desktop Manager LXDE.

You can download the iso and burn it to DVD or install into USB key using for windows ""Pen Drive Linux's USB Installer"" (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows), for Linux ""usb-creator"", for Mac following this tutorial: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx
