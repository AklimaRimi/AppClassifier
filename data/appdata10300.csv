Audience for this tool:
* Advanced system administrators trying to analyze on process level what is going on in a production server;
* Software developers analyzing the troughput of their process: e.g. TCP throughput, memory usage, memory leaks;

The most advanced feature is the monitoring of TCP/IP traffic figures, for each SINGLE process (actual connections and throughput). As far as known no other tool has this capability. In the process tree, use the right mouse button to monitor process details.Project continued at github, see https://github.com/wolfc01/procexp/blob/master/README.md

"Smartcard access lib for Arduino based boards connected directly to a smartcard.

This is currently a work in progress.

Currently it is possible to communicate with a smartcard directly connected to a Arduino board or connected via a TDA8024T (or compatible chips. e.g. DS8024).

All tests have been done with a smart card slot connected directly to the Aruino board.

Working:
- Activation of asynchronous and synchronous smart cards
- Exchanging data with supported Smart card (Sending / Receiving)
- Asychron T=0 APDU communication.
- Basic sychron communication
- ETU calculation from TS byte.
- Support class for SLE4432 / SLE4442 / SLE4441 and SLE4440 compatible sychron smartcards.
Mostly used for secure data storage.

Open points:
- Error handling not completly implemented.
No retries if parity error is found.
