"Q4OS is a fast and friendly, desktop oriented operating system based on Debian Linux. It deploys Plasma, optionally Trinity, as desktop environment on top of Debian Linux rock stable base.

The goal is to provide long-term supported system with a special emphasis on security. This is exactly what Debian base guarantees. We prefer the Debian development model to keep the core system as immutable as possible. It results in a reliable and stable system that you can definitely rely on.

Thanks to unique Q4OS tools a user can rather easily achieve setup of a fitted system eliminating superfluous packages and libraries. Therefore Q4OS performs faster and more efficient, doesn't exploit memory and computing resources with useless tasks and processes.

Another exclusive Q4OS feature is an optimized support for setting up Trinity desktop environment alongside the default Plasma desktop. Installed side by side, carefully separated, both ready to run as needed. Just select one at login.Q4OS is a fast and friendly, desktop oriented operating system based on Debian Linux.

Supported macOS version is 10.12+. Retina display ready! Apple silicon based macs (i.e. M1) are NOT supported!
Linux build is available only for 64-bit systems.

Nothing special required to start using this clock. Just launch it and enjoy! When it starts, apart the clock itself, small tray icon appears (if system tray is available). Tray icon color depends on operating system, in most cases it is black, but on Windows 10 and macOS with dark theme it is white. This tray icon can be used to call clock configuration dialog. Also this dialog can be called using clock context menu.

"Notion is a tiling, tabbed window manager for the X window system:

* Tiling: you divide the screen into non-overlapping 'tiles'. Every window occupies one tile, and is maximized to it

* Tabbing: a tile may contain multiple windows - they will be 'tabbed'

* Static: most tiled window managers are 'dynamic', meaning they automatically resize and move around tiles as windows appear and disappear. Notion, by contrast, does not automatically change the tiling. You're in control.

Features include:

* Workspaces: each workspace has its own tiling

* Multihead: the mod_xinerama plugin provides very nice dual-monitor support

* RandR: mod_xrandr expands on mod_xinerama and picks up changes in the randr configuration without the need for restarting Notion

* Extensibility: Notion can be extended with lua scripts.Notion is a tiling, tabbed window manager for the X window system:
