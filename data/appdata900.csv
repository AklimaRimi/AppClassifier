"Why FinalCrypt?

1. Most people choose Disk-Encryption as it's easier to unlock a whole drive, but Big-Brother or Malware can then also read all your files. Only use File-Encryption!

2. Most software uses recently broken AES encryption.

3. Soon The Shor's algorithm will instantly break all assymmetric encryption with Quantum Computers.

4. FinalCrypt uses Symmetric One Time Pad Encryption, which is the most unbreakable encryption there is.

5. FinalCrypt is the only ""One Time Pad"", OpenSource, Cross-Platform, (Bulk) File Encryption Software available.Why FinalCrypt?
