You can access RDP, SSH, VNC, TELNET and other protocol assets in a system without plug-ins, just a browser. You can view the currently active sessions at any time, and monitor and block them. For character protocols, you can even restrict the execution and logging of certain commands. Next Terminal observes and logs every online resource, connection, interactive session and other security event in all environments. These events are recorded in a structured audit log, making it easy to see what is happening and who is responsible. Next Terminal is developed with Golang. After compilation, there is only one binary file, and the built-in sqlite can be used to store files.

If it doesn't work or you don't have the right polyfills because you are on an older Ember version, then v1.4.9 will be your best bet. Ember Infinity is based on a component-service approach wherein your application is viewed as an interaction between your components (ephemeral state) and service (long-term state). As a result, we can intelligently store your model state to provide you the ability to cache and invalidate your cache when you need to. If you provide an optional infinityCache timestamp (in ms), the infinity service model hook will return the existing collection (and not make a network request) if the timestamp has not yet expired.

"Easy and fun way to work with remote servers over SSH. This project is being renamed as previous name ""Snowflake"" is confusing since there is already a popular product with the same name. Muon is a graphical SSH client. It has an enhanced SFTP file browser, SSH terminal emulator, remote resource/process manager, server disk space analyzer, remote text editor, huge remote log viewer, and lots of other helpful tools, which makes it easy to work with remote servers. Muon provides functionality similar to web-based control panels but, it works over SSH from the local computer, hence no installation is required on the server. It runs on Linux and Windows. Muon has been tested with several Linux and UNIX servers, like Ubuntu server, CentOS, RHEL, OpenSUSE, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and HP-UX. The application is targeted mainly towards web/backend developers who often deploy/debug their code on remote servers and not overly fond of complex terminal-based commands.Easy and fun way to work with remote servers over SSH.

"Execa improves child processes execution with a promise interface, cross-platform support, local binaries, interleaved output, and more. nvexeca is a thin wrapper around Execa to run any file or command using any Node.js version. nvexeca executes a single file or command. It does not change the node nor npm global binaries. To run a specific Node.js version for an entire project or shell session, please use nvm, nvm-windows, n or nvs instead. This package is an ES module and must be loaded using an import or import() statement, not require(). File or command to execute. Both global and local binaries can be executed. The first time nvexeca is run with a new VERSION, the Node binary is downloaded under the hood. This initially takes few seconds. However subsequent runs are almost instantaneous.Execa improves child processes execution with a promise interface, cross-platform support, local binaries, interleaved output, and more. nvexeca is a thin wrapper around Execa to run any file or command using any Node.js version. nvexeca executes a single file or command.

"CLI to interactively upgrade Gradle dependencies, inspired by yarn. Easily upgrade your dependencies and Gradle itself by simply selecting what you want to upgrade. To get the data for the outdated dependencies, the gradle-versions-plugin is required. Simply run gradle-upgrade-interactive. The gradle-versions-plugin is called to generate a JSON report containing the outdated dependencies. The CLI will then prompt all outdated dependencies and the selected dependency upgrades will be written to the Gradle build file.CLI to interactively upgrade Gradle dependencies, inspired by yarn.

"Run any command on specific Node.js versions. node >=14.18.0 must be globally installed. However the command run by nve can use any Node version (providing it is compatible with it). The first time nve is run with a new VERSION, the Node binary is downloaded under the hood. This initially takes few seconds. However subsequent runs are almost instantaneous. Tools like nvm, nvm-windows, n or nvs are meant to execute a specific Node.js version for an entire machine, project or shell session. It does not need a separate installation step for each Node version, it can run the major release's latest minor/patch version automatically, works on Windows. No need to run as Administrator. It does not require Bash and it is installed as a Node module (as opposed to a Bash installation script downloaded with curl).Run any command on specific Node.js versions. node >=14.18.0 must be globally installed.

"A simple command line tool for text to image generation, using OpenAI's CLIP and a BigGAN. Ryan Murdock has done it again, combining OpenAI's CLIP and the generator from a BigGAN! This repository wraps up his work so it is easily accessible to anyone who owns a GPU. You will be able to have the GAN dream-up images using natural language with a one-line command in the terminal. User-made notebook with bug fixes and added features, like google drive integration. Images will be saved to wherever the command is invoked. If you have enough memory, you can also try using a bigger vision model released by OpenAI for improved generations. You can set the number of classes that you wish to restrict Big Sleep to use for the Big GAN with the --max-classes flag as follows (ex. 15 classes). This may lead to extra stability during training, at the cost of lost expressivity.A simple command line tool for text to image generation, using OpenAI's CLIP and a BigGAN.

"Amazon ECS has released AWS Copilot, a command-line interface (CLI) tool that simplifies building, releasing, and operating production-ready containerized applications on Amazon ECS from a local development environment. The Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) command-line interface (CLI) provides high-level commands to simplify creating, updating, and monitoring clusters and tasks from a local development environment. The Amazon ECS CLI supports Docker Compose files, a popular open-source specification for defining and running multi-container applications. Use the ECS CLI as part of your everyday development and testing cycle as an alternative to the AWS Management Console. The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified client for AWS services that provides commands for all public API operations. These commands are lower level than those provided by the Amazon ECS CLI.Amazon ECS has released AWS Copilot, a command-line interface (CLI) tool that simplifies building, releasing, and operating production-ready containerized applications on Amazon ECS from a local development environment.
