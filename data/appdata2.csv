Previously, development were using Delphi language. Some attempts to rewrite it in other languages were done, but currently (since January 2012) there is an attempt or rewrite using those technologies:
_ C++11
_ wxWidgets 2.9 (will be 3.0 when it will be released)
_ openGL
_ pluma framework (a fixed version located on bitbucket)

The design of the actual C++ code-base primarily targets clean source code and high modularity of source code, to allow easy reuse of the code and fast learning for people who might join the effort.

Current development is located on https://bitbucket.org/bmorel/autorealm . Howerver, older repositories are still here in case someone would like to consult them, and to allow easy access to algorithms they might contain.AutoREALM is a free role-playing game mapping program originally made by Andrew Gryc.

Nice news for those who love Super Smash Flash game, the upgraded version is better and better with an extra 3 playable characters to swell the ranks too (Marth, Zero Suit Samus and Chibi-Robo).

Super Smash Flash 2's gameplay is very similar to the official Super Smash Bros. However, the most interesting feature of SSF2 is that character's health is measured by a damage percentage counter. It means a character is attacked, the damage will be accumulated, and percent value gets high.

The controls of Super Smash Flash 2 are also different from the previous version. Make use of WASD keys to move Player while the arrow keys are used to control second player. The O and P keys still remain in P-1's possession, the P key for standard attacks, the I key for shield, and the 1 key for taunting.SSF2 Fan Club: https://www.facebook.com/SuperSmashFlash2FC/

Select one or more FCM/GCM, APNS, WNS or WebPush devices and in the action dropdown, select ""Send test message"" or ""Send test message in bulk"", accordingly. Note that sending a non-bulk test message to more than one device will just iterate over the devices and send multiple single messages. UPDATE_ON_DUPLICATE_REG_ID: Transform create of an existing Device (based on registration id) into an update. Sending messages in bulk makes use of the bulk mechanics offered by GCM and APNS. It is almost always preferable to send bulk notifications instead of single ones.","Categories

"Using the Android SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth Devices, you can create mobile applications that do the following. Scan for and connect to nearby BLE devices running FreeRTOS. Perform WiFi provisioning of the FreeRTOS BLE devices after connecting to them ( Only supported for Espressif ESP32-DevKitC ). Act as a proxy for transmitting MQTT messages between a device running FreeRTOS and the AWS IoT cloud. The SDK includes some functions that help you perform BLE operations with FreeRTOS devices. Once the connection to the device is established, you get an AmazonFreeRTOSDevice object, and you can use this object to do WiFi provisioning or Mqtt proxy. The MQTT proxy service controls the MQTT proxy. It allows the device to send and receive MQTT messages from the AWS IoT cloud through the phone, when this feature is enabled. The SDK includes a demo application that demonstrates some of the main features of the SDK.Using the Android SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth Devices, you can create mobile applications that do the following.

Reuse the source code of the independent installation App. The source code of the plug-in App can be installed and run normally. Zero reflection and no Hack implementation of plug-in technology. In theory, it has been determined that there is no need for compatible development of any system, and there is no hidden API call, which does not conflict with Google's strategy of restricting access to non-public SDK interfaces. It is difficult to implement a perfect plug-in framework at one time, but Shadow makes all these implementations dynamic so that the code of the plug-in framework becomes part of the plug-in.Shadow is an Android plug-in framework independently developed by Tencent, which has been tested by hundreds of millions of online users.

"With mobile development, showing images in an app has become a very frequent task. But with the ever-increasing resolution of smartphone cameras, image compression has become a rather important concern. Although there are already a lot of writings on the internet on the topic, a great number of possible scenarios still have to be thought of, like unsuccessful compressions, too small pictures (eg. for profile pictures) or too bad image quality. Naturally, the first idea was to see how WeChat, the app giant manages this task in action. To gather data, 100 images with different resolutions were sent through WeChat Moments, then the compressed images were compared with the original ones. Luban's foundation is the result of this analysis on WeChat's compression method. Because the process was analyzed backward, Luban's efficacy is not yet exactly the same as that of WeChat, but the results are already very close to what WeChat Moments' image compression produces.With mobile development, showing images in an app has become a very frequent task.

In addition, you can alter the relative position of the tooltip text by placing a colon and a percentage value (-100 to 100) after the position text, eg ""top:-50"". This will slide the tooltip along the length or height of the element away from the center. If you want to increase the distance of the tooltip from the element, you can do it by placing a comma and a percentage value (100, 200, 300, 400 or 500) after the tooltip offset, eg ""top:0,200"".

That said, it works all the way down to 2.1 but is not actively tested or working perfectly. The goal of this project is to deliver a high performance replacement to ListView. You should with minimal effort and time be able to add section headers to a list. This should be done via a simple to use API without any special features. This library will always priorities general use cases over special ones. This means that the library will add very few public methods to the standard ListView and will not try to work for every use case.StickyListHeaders is an Android library that makes it easy to integrate section headers in your ListView.

PocketHub it's been released to the community and maintained as a public project. We are actively working towards a re-release to the Play Store, and this app will be the spiritual successor to the original GitHub app. We're shooting for an initial re-release just to get the app out there. There have been a significant number of changes since the app was last updated, with many functional and design changes that we need to make sure are good to go. Much of the UI has already been touched up with elements of Material Design, but we have a long ways to go.

On the other hand, the browser default control styles are few and ugly, making a beautiful control is very troublesome, and there are some simple UI frameworks but low performance.

It was originally built to make Facebook's Paper possible, and goes hand-in-hand with pop's physics-based animations — but it's just as powerful with UIKit Dynamics and conventional app designs. More recently, it was used to power Pinterest's app rewrite. As the framework has grown, many features have been added that can save developers tons of time by eliminating common boilerplate style structures common in modern iOS apps. If you've ever dealt with cell reuse bugs, tried to performantly preload data for a page or scroll style interface or even just tried to keep your app from dropping too many frames you can benefit from integrating Texture. Texture lets you move image decoding, text sizing and rendering, and other expensive UI operations off the main thread, to keep the main thread available to respond to user interaction.Texture is an iOS framework built on top of UIKit that keeps even the most complex user interfaces smooth and responsive.

The core is inspired by the implementation of iscroll (opens new window), so the APIs of BetterScroll are compatible with iscroll on the whole. What's more, BetterScroll also extends some features and optimizes for performance based on iscroll. BetterScroll is implemented with plain JavaScript, which means it's dependency free. BetterScroll provides a class whose first parameter is a plain DOM object when instantiated. Certainly, BetterScroll inside would try to use querySelector to get the DOM object. In BetterScroll 2.X, we split the 1.X-coupled feature into the plugin to achieve on-demand loading and reduce the volume of the package. Therefore, @better-scroll/core only provides the most core scrolling capabilities.

"Parallax Engine that reacts to the orientation of a smart device. Where no gyroscope or motion detection hardware is available, the position of the cursor is used instead. parallax.js reacts to the orientation of your smart device, offsetting layers depending on their depth within a scene. If you don't have a smart device, no worries, if no gyroscope or motion detection hardware is available, parallax.js uses the position of your cursor instead. Most configuration settings can be declared either as data-value attribute of the scene element, or property of the configuration object. The programmatic approach will take priority over the data-value attributes set in the HTML. Some options can also be set at run-time via instance methods.

"Everyday life history is becoming of high interest due to the growing amount of various historical sources related to common human being. Analysis of such sources needs considering them as interrelated. Evaluation of such relations leads to meaningful results for different groups of information consumers: from professional historians and experts from close humanitarian sciences to common people, interested in everyday community life. Corpuses of everyday life history sources are being collected in many museums and document archives. In this project, we consider the problem of creating software infrastructure for collaborative semantic annotation, information relation, and personalized access to corpus of everyday life history sources.

"RLCD makes it easy to control small embedded devices from Android. It provides a simulated LCD that devices control wirelessly to display a simple text-based UI. RLCD sends touches on the LCD to the embedded device enabling interactive UIs. Thus small faceless resource-constrained devices can have a dynamic interactive ""app"" on mobile devices.

The Remote LCD protocol is simple and open allowing simulated display implementations on other mobile OSes. To see the handful of commands that make up the protocol please check out the readme on the code page. We will gladly accept contributions of the protocol implemented on other OSes.

It allows you to choose an audio file, and record a video while the audio is simultaneously playing. You can record yourself in a quiet environment using earphones. The high-quality recording can be used as an audition tape of yourself. On speakers, the audio will interfere, so unless that is what you want, I recommend earphones.

"CIMON (Configurable Integrated Monitoring system) is a monitoring service which provides a layer of abstraction to support monitoring and context-aware applications. Android applications can use the CIMON API to easily register monitors, and the CIMON monitoring service will integrate each of these requests to meet their needs efficiently.

There are a variety of metrics supported related to system status and activity, sensors, and user activity. CIMON also supports registering of complex monitors which are represented by boolean expressions. These monitors can notify applications when a particular event or condition has occurred.

In addition to the monitoring service, there is an administration app, shown in the screenshots, which allows you to easily add new monitors.

For more complete information, check out the project homepage. The complete JavaDoc is available at the homepage. The source code is freely available and can be extended to include additional metrics.CIMON (Configurable Integrated Monitoring system) is a monitoring service which provides a layer of abstraction to support monitoring and context-aware applications.

"This project consists of two shell scrips.

One splits an adb backup into several ones by app name extracting the contents of the tars to a temporal folder and then re-taring everything to get the individual ab for each android app.

The other shell script uses Tar Binary Splitter to divide the main tar inside the adb backup without extracting anything from the tar, so is by far the best method.

Other software is needed. The bundle is included in Android Backup Extractor, with the full README as well:

The end result will be a ""DOM-like"" collection of memory.

"This is a simple proof-of-concept which shows how to implement a custom minimalistic Keyboard and the according algorithms for selecting the right words.

This Project was inspired by the ""minuum"" project, which was not available at the time of writing this, so i implemented my own version.

A dirty implementation can be seen here:
http://tyrael.homeip.net/minimum_keyboard/


I you think, there are Features misssing, just implement them yourself. It is easy. This Project is also an educational one.

For example: sloppy typing.
Just think what this means: the user presses a Little bit to the left or right, which means: the Position and value pairs of ""en_hashes"" must be adjusted +- 1. Thats all.

The same goes for missing words: just Import another book (basically any ASCII file, or Import your mail conversations).

Or let the database learn from user Inputs. Just update the ""en_context"" score after the user selects a word.

"Linear Program Solver (LiPS) is an optimization package oriented on solving linear, integer and goal programming problems.
The main features of LiPS are:
● LiPS is based on the efficient implementation of the modified simplex method that solves large scale problems.
● LiPS provides not just an answer, but a detailed solution process as a sequence of simplex tables, so you can use it for studying/teaching linear programming.
● LiPS gives sensitivity analysis procedures, which allow us to study the behaviour of the model when you change its parameters, including: analysis of changes in the right sides of constraints, analysis of changes in the coefficients of the objective function, analysis of changes in the column/row of the technology matrix. Such information may be extremely useful for the practical application of LP Models.
● LiPS provides methods of goal programming, including lexicographic and weighted GP methods, which are oriented on multi-objective optimisation.Linear Program Solver (LiPS) is an optimization package oriented on solving linear, integer and goal programming problems.

pdfsandwich is a command line tool which is supposed to be useful to OCR scanned books or journals. It is able to recognize the page layout even for multicolumn text.

Essentially, pdfsandwich is a wrapper script which calls the following binaries: convert, unpaper, tesseract, gs, and hocr2pdf (if tesseract < 3.03). It is known to run on Unix systems and has been tested on Linux and MacOS X. It supports parallel processing on multiprocessor systems.

In contrast to most competing sandwich programs, it performs preprocessing of the scanned images, such as de-skewing or removal of dark edges etc.

"Entity Resolution is the process by which a dataset is processed and records are identified that represent the same real-world entity.

OYSTER (Open sYSTem Entity Resolution) is an entity resolution system that supports probabilistic direct matching, transitive linking, and asserted linking. To facilitate prospecting for match candidates (blocking), the system builds and maintains an in-memory index of attribute values to identities. Because OYSTER has an identity management system, it also supports persistent identity identifiers. OYSTER is unique among other ER systems in that it is built to incorporate Entity Identity Information Management (EIIM). OYSTER supports EIIM by providing methods that enforce identifiers to be unique among identities, maintain persistent IDs over the life of an identity, and allowing the ability to fix false-positive and false-negative resolutions, which cannot be done with matching rules, through the use of assertion, traceability, and other features.Entity Resolution is the process by which a dataset is processed and records are identified that represent the same real-world entity.

"TRAK is a general systems-thinkers'/system-centric enterprise architecture framework. It is simple, user-friendly, pragmatic and not limited to IT. TRAK has won an INCOSE award and is also a finalist in the 2011 IET innovation awards.

TRAK allows you to describe a system, its parts (which can include people, software, other systems and physical things) and how it relates to the residual world. It covers everything from the enterprise, concept, procurement of the solution, the introduction or withdrawal of the system from service to its assurance. It allows threats,risks and mitigation to be linked to the design.

TRAK is a derivative of MODAF but is based on ISO/IEC 42010 - the international standard for architecture description. There is a minimal process in which the architect selects the viewpoints (specifications for views) that address the task sponsor's concerns. It has rules that ensure that the description is consistent and also readable by the non technical audience. YouTRAK is a general systems-thinkers'/system-centric enterprise architecture framework.

"Hello everyone

This tool is created for people who own a scanner with a document feeder which isn't able to scan duplex (both sides of a sheet in one scan).

Note: This tool runs on all computer-platforms! :)

Step by Step:
1. Scan all sheets frontsided to one PDF-file.
2. Without changing the sort of the sheets, turn the whole bunch of sheets and scan it again (all the backsides). It's important to scan the same amount of pages (even the empty ones), like before! Otherwise it won't work properly.
3. Start the ""DuplexMerger"". Add the path to the frontsided PDF into the first textfield, the path to the backsided PDF into the second textfield (you can also use the ""browse"" function).
4. Click ""Merge"" and chose a path to save the new file.
5. Done!

Feel free to donate me 10 Cents. :D

Have fun! :)

"Let's say you want to save paper when printing a document. To do so, you can print on both sides of paper sheets or print multiple pages on each side of the sheets, like done in handouts. Most printers and printer dialogues don't offer an easy way to do these two simple tasks, that's where dualPrint comes in.

Tell dualPrint basic information about the document's pages and it will generate the outputs to copy into the printer dialogues. dualPrint eliminates the need to manually change between odd and even pages, which can be tricky to find among different programs and printing dialogues. Finally, it guides you in the process of inverting pages so you won't have to waste paper on trial and error.Let's say you want to save paper when printing a document.

"Pascal's Triangle has been taken into higher dimensions. The Five Platonic Solids are included in this software, along with various geometric algorithms to create a generative geometry system. Equations in combinatoric and algebraic forms are given. Tools to play with the data are given. There is now a way to create user-defined algorithms. Dodecahedral and Icosahedral Pascalloids are now geometrically perfect and include no 'folding errors'. A 'data only' data output mode allows users to copy and paste the geometry data into any spreadsheet.

Polarized (+/-) geometries for all shapes are included as an option, including special tools to work with both negative and positive numbers that appear in the revolving geometry display.

If your city is not in the database (unlikely, since it has 36,000 cities in it), just feed it the latitude and longitude of your place (Get that from Google Earth) and it will calculate the times of Namaz.

Options for calculating according to Hanafi and Shafe'ee schools of Jurisprudence.

Other options include Height of your location (which changes the salat timing...)

Now don't miss a prayer even if you are on the tip of Everest :)

You can also customize your Fajr and Isha timings with a customized twilight angle...depending on the traditions at your place.

Prepare customized printouts for the entire year...

All this with a Jazzy interface and Adans from Medina, Mecca and more...
