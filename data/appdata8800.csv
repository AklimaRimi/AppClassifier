"pdfsandwich generates ""sandwich"" OCR pdf files, i.e. pdf files which contain only images (but no editable text) will be processed by optical character recognition (OCR) and the text will be added to each page invisibly ""behind"" the images.

pdfsandwich is a command line tool which is supposed to be useful to OCR scanned books or journals. It is able to recognize the page layout even for multicolumn text.

Essentially, pdfsandwich is a wrapper script which calls the following binaries: convert, unpaper, tesseract, gs, and hocr2pdf (if tesseract < 3.03). It is known to run on Unix systems and has been tested on Linux and MacOS X. It supports parallel processing on multiprocessor systems.

In contrast to most competing sandwich programs, it performs preprocessing of the scanned images, such as de-skewing or removal of dark edges etc.

This approach makes it possible to sum the forces of each project (Chromium, SVG/HTML5, PHP, Lua, SQLite, Inkscape, Lib61850, OpenDNP3, Nginx, Vega, PostgreSQL, Grafana,…) to achieve a great set of open, evergreen, modular and customizable tools for building great HMIs for automation projects.
This is not a toy project! It's been actually used in dozens of substations up to 230kV level and also in control centers with configurations up to 70.000 tags.

REDUCE has a long and distinguished place in the history of computer algebra systems.

REDUCE primarily runs on either Portable Standard Lisp (PSL) or Codemist Standard Lisp (CSL), both of which are included in the SourceForge distribution.

"GeigerLog is a combination of data logger, presenter, and analyzer, and now released as version 1.4.1 !

Based on Python (Version 3), hence runs on Linux, Windows, Macs, Raspberry Pi, and other. It now also runs on HiDPI screens.

GeigerLog can be monitored by SmartPhone; it is WiFi enabled for servers and clients.

Initially developed for Geiger counters, it is now a more universal tool, which equally well handles data like temperature, air-pressure, humidity, CO2. Continues to support GQ Electronic's GMC-300/500/600 Geiger counters, RadMon and other IoT devices, Gamma-Scout Geiger counters, audio-clicks producing counters, I2C based sensors.

GeigerLog reads data from the devices, saves them to databases, prints to screen and plots as graph of Values vs Time. The graph is auto-updated and can be customized.

Quality control using Statistics, Scatter, Poisson Test, FFT & Autocorrelation, and more.

models of the formula.
(2) Logical entailment: In this mode the user can insert a number of
premises followed by a number of conclusions, so the Logic Calculator displays
the truth table of each premise / conclusion and the result of whether or not
these premises logically entail the given conclusions.
(3) Conversion of a formula to Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) and Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF): In this mode the user inserts a logic formula and the Logic

"Card generator for the russian L1-3/L3-3 tube tester.

WARNING: The software is still in alpha state, so there are definitely some bugs. If you want to use the created cards for real tests, check them manually with EXTREME care first .. else damage or destruction of your tester can easily occur. ESPECIALLY check if multiple conflicting functions are assigned to the same line (by looking on the universal card), which would lead to shorts.

New release!

Most of the old bugs should (still, no guarantees) be fixed by now and lots of functionality added. I created a good amount of cards for myself and they were all fine, so I deceided to make a public alpha release again. I also added a short manual (only German by now, translation soon follows) including a few examples.

The OSAF-Toolkit is built from Ubuntu 11.10 and pre-compiled with all of the tools needed to rip apart applications for code review and malware analysis. Our primary goal with the toolkit is to be able to make application analysis as easy as possible. We also wanted to create a community where security professionals, analysts, developers and newcommers can learn, discuss and share methodologies with one another.

Follow us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/OpenSourceAndroidForensicsWelcome to OSAF! The OSAF-Toolkit was developed, as a senior design project, by a group of IT students from the University of Cincinnati, wanting to pioneer and pave the way for standardization of Android malware analysis. The OSAF-Toolkit is built from Ubuntu 11.10 and pre-compiled with all of the tools needed to rip apart applications for code review and malware analysis. Our primary goal with the toolkit is to be able to make application analysis as easy as possible. We also wanted to create a community where security professionals, analysts, developers and newcommers can learn, discuss and share methodologies with one another.

"A Java package that provides routines for various statistical distributions. Based on R version 2.14.1 (continuously updated; current as of R v3.3.0). The major difference is that JDistlib is thread safe. The library contains the density (pdf), cumulative (cdf), quantile, and random number generator (RNG) routines of the following distributions: Ansari, Beta, Binomial, Cauchy, Chi square, Exponential, Fisher's F, Gamma, Geometric, Hypergeometric, Kendall, Logistic, Log normal, Negative binomial, Noncentral beta, Noncentral chi square, Noncentral f, Noncentral t, Normal, Poisson, Sign Rank, Spearman, Student's T, Tukey, Uniform, Weibull, Wilcoxon, and many more. Normality tests, such as: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cramer-Von Mises, D'Agostino-Pearson, Jarque Bera, Kolmogorov-Lilliefors, Shapiro-Francia, Shapiro-Wilk.

It provides a general framework for using a great variety of algorithms for direct optimal control, including model predictive control, state and parameter estimation and robust optimization. ACADO Toolkit is implemented as self-contained C++ code and comes along with user-friendly MATLAB interface. The object-oriented design allows for convenient coupling of existing optimization packages and for extending it with user-written optimization routines.ACADO Toolkit is a software environment and algorithm collection for automatic control and dynamic optimization.

"Scene is a computer vision framework that performs background subtraction and object tracking, using two traditional algorithms and three more recent algorithms based on neural networks and fuzzy classification rules. For each detected object, Scene sends TUIO messages to one or several client applications. The present release features GPU accelerated versions of all the background subtraction methods and morphological post processing of the object blobs with dilation and erosion filters, implemented in OpenCL. The framework was mainly designed as a toolkit for the rapid development of interactive art projects that explore dynamics of complex environments. The Scene GUI runs and compiles under Windows, Linux, and MacOS X, and is available in both 32 bit and 64 bit versions.Scene is a computer vision framework that performs background subtraction and object tracking, using two traditional algorithms and three more recent algorithms based on neural networks and fuzzy classification rules.

It's a 3D, physically realistic truck/car simulator, oriented to dirt tracks. This is subsancially kept as hystorical. The environment is a hilly terrain which can also be user-defined in the form of a Bitmap image file (where intensity of red component defines height). It's similar to the classic ""Terep 2"". Particular care for internal cam. Written in standard C. There's a Windows executable ready for use, but it's compilable and playable on all Linux, BSD, MacOSX systems. Official VIDEO presentation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B74QvPGyBYM

The physical simulation was written from 0 of course, so no external 'third-party' libraries are used; except GLUT+OpenGL for the graphical visualisation & good interactivity.update:
