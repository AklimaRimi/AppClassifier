CCCLI is a functional system currently being used at Camosun College. Currently, it is roughly mid-to-late Alpha stage. It works, but it is site-specific, there is no installer, configuration and use is extremely technical, and the code-base needs a complete rewrite. Administration is via server-based PowerShell script. There is no GUI yet.","Categories

"This tool can interest you, if you want to copy files from a folder to another and keep a save of the overwrit ones.
The tool just need a source folder, a destination folder and a diff folder (where save files will be stored).

You can also use a ""revert"" functionnality to revert all modifications, using the diff folder :)

This tool can also be used with normal interface or by command-line.
