"LosslessCut aims to be the ultimate cross platform FFmpeg GUI for extremely fast and lossless operations on video, audio, subtitle and other related media files. The main feature is lossless trimming and cutting of video and audio files, which is great for saving space by rough-cutting your large video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc. It lets you quickly extract the good parts from your videos and discard many gigabytes of data without doing a slow re-encode and thereby losing quality. Or you can add a music or subtitle track to your video without needing to encode. Everything is extremely fast because it does an almost direct data copy, fueled by the awesome FFmpeg which does all the grunt work.

"With the growing need to exchange information and share resources, information security has become more important than ever in both the public and private sectors. Although many technologies have been developed to control access to files or resources, to enforce security policies, and to audit network usages, there does not exist a technology that can verify that the user who is using the system is the same person who logged in.

FaceAccess provides a prototype implementation as a ""login module"" of an information system. The goal is to enhance the level of system security by periodically checking the user’s identity without disrupting the user’s activities.

Installation instructions can be found in the package. If you need anymore guidance, please use the Wiki to post any kind of inquiry.

Thanks a bunch.With the growing need to exchange information and share resources, information security has become more important than ever in both the public and private sectors. Although many technologies have been developed to control access to files or resources, to enforce security policies, and to audit network usages, there does not exist a technology that can verify that the user who is using the system is the same person who logged in.

FaceAccess provides a prototype implementation as a ""login module"" of an information system. The goal is to enhance the level of system security by periodically checking the user’s identity without disrupting the user’s activities.

Installation instructions can be found in the package. If you need anymore guidance, please use the Wiki to post any kind of inquiry.

NB: Please Donate to support the development of this project. PM me for other means. Any kind of support will be very much appreciated. Thanks a bunch.","Categories

"NCandE grants the popular Notepad++ text editor the capability to compile and execute any code, with native support for Ada, Batch, C, C++, D, Java, Lua and Python code. Custom languages can be added with the built-in GUI Configuration Tool. The compile (Build) and run (Execute) functions are added under the Run command in Notepad ++.

The ""Build"" and ""Execute"" commands automatically detect which compiler is necessary for the file running the commands. Custom paths, commands and switches for compilers can also be easily implemented with the GUI Configuration Tool.

I am a PHP developer and i often see an 'require_once(""../this/is/some/file.php"");'. In pspad you can select the whole path (../this/is/some/file.php) and open it from the menu.

Took a while but CodeBlocks is now upto speed and in sync with the current release version.
New version of CodeBlocks supports XML based configuration, so users can do specialized compiler support if needed.
Changed away from the old Msys in favor of Msys2 which has better support for a lot of things like miktex.
Old package is still there if you still need it but wont be developed on anymore.
Loads of modifications compared to the Msys2 package from Alex, you can still update Msys2 packages from his server though.
MinGW64 packages have to many changes compared to Alex version so those will not upgrade but im working on creating my own package server.

"Important: Groimp migrates to Gitlab. You can find the latest code and documentation at https://gitlab.com/grogra/groimp/-/wikis/home. The version on Sourceforge will not be updated anymore.

The modelling platform GroIMP is designed as an integrated platform which incorporates modelling, visualisation and interaction. It exhibits several features which makes itself suitable for the field of biological or ALife modelling:

The “modelling backbone” consists in the language XL. It is fully integrated, e.g., the user can interactively select the rules to be applied.
GroIMP provides classes that can be used in modelling: Turtle commands, further geometrical classes like bicubic surfaces, the class Cell which has been used in the Game Of Life implementation, and so on.
The outcome of a model is visualised within GroIMP.
In the visual representation of the model output, users can interact with the dynamics of the model, e.g., by selecting or deleting elements.Important: Groimp migrates to Gitlab.
