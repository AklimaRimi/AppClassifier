"Controversial ideas of Williamson, Margulis & others suggest speciation by hybridizing might be more common than originally thought.

Taking this concept to the nth degree & assuming that indeed, speciation mostly occurs by hybridizing events, not the accumulation of mutations or genetic drift, here is a catalogueoflife2gedcom converter. It allows the tree of life to be displayed as a human genealogy tree with hybridizing events depicted as ""marriages."" The idea then is that mutation accrual & genetic drift are the determining factors for ""species maturation,"" not speciation itself.

Unfortunately the Catalogue of Life Project, catalogueoflife.org, changed its database format more recently, so this converter only works on older versions of the data. In the last working version of the database, making the assumption that each taxonomic name, no matter what level, refers to an original real species & starting them all as female, over 2 million ""species/persons"" were generated.Controversial ideas of Williamson, Margulis & others suggest speciation by hybridizing might be more common than originally thought.

Popppy simulates a population of men and women over a period of time in 1 year time-steps, implementing marriages, births, and deaths. Execution starts with an input consisting of given numbers of men and women of particular ages. It does a decent job predicting 10 to 20 years ahead. Beyond that the input parameters fertility rate, marriage age and mortality rates could change in an unpredictable manner. The tool could also be useful and fun for a student, for anyone curious about near-future demographics or CO2 emissions, or curious amateurs. Since it's Open Source (<2000 lines of Python code) you can make your own changes.

It runs from the command line and should run on any (MS WIndows, Linux/Unix/Mac OSX) platform running Python 3. A non-Python MS Windows pre-compiled Popppy executable/binary is included for those who just want to run it without having the bother of installing Python 3.x or not wanting to change the source code.EXPECTED RELEASE DATE 12TH AUG 2020

It was specially designed to restore panoramas obtained by Apollo missions in 1969-1972 but it can be used to restore any cyclorama from photos got in your tourist trip (for example). The main principle of the program is in projecting photos on a 360x360 sphere and combining it together. If you select a correct field of view (FOV) for photo images, its combination become ideal for distant points. For moon cyclorama it is also possible to check a Sun and Earth positions on the sky and to compare the result with a LOLA data (provided by the the LRO moon satellite).This application allows visually restore a cyclorama from a set of photos covering 360 degrees in all directions to horizon.

"Belief revision is a central topic in knowledge representation and reasoning. It consists in incorporating a new belief, changing as few as
possible of the original beliefs while preserving consistency.

Revision always considers new evidence as a better belief. Such new evidence is usually
represented in the form of a propositional formula which must be preserved after the
revision.

Here, the Δps (PS-Merge) belief merging operator is extended in order to consider constraints, and this extension is used as a strategy for belief revision. The new evidence is treated as a constraint so the extended merging operator can obtain the revised belief base.Belief revision is a central topic in knowledge representation and reasoning.

"A small project, to measure the visual bias when judging tritones.

The ""tritone"" consists of 2 distinct shepard tones with half an octave tone difference, played successively.

Every human has it's own way of perception: One would say after hearing the C-F# tritone, that the F# is clearly higher-pitched than the C, but another person would judge the C as the higher tone.

We tried to measure, if there is a possibility of manipulating the perception by adding a visual stimulus by using this program coded in C++.

Our outcomes are, that it is possible to manipulate the perceptions of the individuals significantly by a visual stimulus.

If you're interested in retesting our outcomes, feel free to download, use and edit this program by your own needs.

The code is quick and dirty but I will clear it up, as soon I have the time.A small project, to measure the visual bias when judging tritones.

"Due to the overwhelming amount of evidence of fraud within the electronic voting process, I feel tht it is time to make an open sourced voting system that is as close to bullet proof as possible.

To start this process off, I will be gathering system requirements from various concerned groups. Once requirements have been gathered, a decision on software and hardware specifications will be made.Due to the overwhelming amount of evidence of fraud within the electronic voting process, I feel tht it is time to make an open sourced voting system that is as close to bullet proof as possible.

"The Wittgen programming language consists of just two instructions and one special variable name.

Wittgen allows you to assign any text string to a variable of any name. It also allows you to retrieve the text assigned to that variable. Lastly, it has a special variable called “Doing Now”. Every execution step consists of retrieving the contents of Doing Now, removing the first assign found in that content and performing that assign. In the course of performing that assign any retrieve operations indicated in the text are performed before committing the assign. That is all there the system does.

The driving motivation for this design is that as far as we know, the human mind supports these two instructions.It may have additional mechanisms that create new assigns, but using the results of these mechanisms requires a system built from these instructions.The Wittgen programming language consists of just two instructions and one special variable name.

The aim is simplify and enrich cost and budget open data and make them understandable by all, by directly involving transparency offices and public project managers. ETNA scope is to create real value for citizens from Spending Open Data (budget, transactions and procurements) as well as for administrations who can improve the quality of data released and being more effective in project management.ETNA is a project of a federated social network (based on already developed open source software i.e. buddycloud) for implementing participatory auditing on open spending data actually released by public entities and some private companies.
