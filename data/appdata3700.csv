"Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web, REST, XML-RPC, and e-mail interfaces. It runs on python 2.7 or 3.6 or newer.

Roundup has been deployed for:

* bug tracking and TODO list management (the classic installation)
* customer help desk support (with a wizard for the phone answerers, linking to networking, system and development issue trackers)
* issue management for IETF working groups
* sales lead tracking

...and so on. It's been designed with flexibility in mind - it's not just another bug
tracker. Roundup ships with a *demo tracker* to play with - after
you've unpacked the source, just run ""python demo.py"" and load up the
URL it prints out!
