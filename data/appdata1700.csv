"The source code has been migrated and is now hosted on Github: https://github.com/jenetics/jenetics

Jenetics is an advanced Genetic Algorithm, Evolutionary Algorithm and Genetic Programming library, respectively, written in modern day Java. It is designed with a clear separation of the several algorithm concepts, e. g. Gene, Chromosome, Genotype, Phenotype, Population and fitness Function. Jenetics allows you to minimize or maximize the given fitness function without tweaking it. In contrast to other GA implementations, the library uses the concept of an evolution stream (EvolutionStream) for executing the evolution steps. Since the EvolutionStream implements the Java Stream interface, it works smoothly with the rest of the Java Stream API.
