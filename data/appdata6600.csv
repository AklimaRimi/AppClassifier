"Equalizer APO is a parametric / graphic equalizer for Windows. It is implemented
as an Audio Processing Object (APO) for the system effect infrastructure
introduced with Windows Vista.

Features:
- virtually unlimited number of filters
- works on any number of channels
- very low latency, which makes it suited for interactive applications
- low CPU usage
- modular graphical user interface
- VST plugin support
- integrates into Voicemeeter (http://www.voicemeeter.com/)

Requirements:
- Windows Vista or later (currently only Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and 11 have been tested)
- the application must not bypass the system effect infrastructure
(APIs like ASIO or WASAPI exclusive mode can not be used)

Equalizer APO is best used in conjunction with Room EQ Wizard (http://www.roomeqwizard.com/), because it can read its filter text file format.

"Crazy Eddie's GUI (CEGUI) system is a graphical user interface C++ library. It was designed particularly for the needs of videogames, but the library is usable for non-game tasks, such as any other type of applications (rendering/visualisation/virtual reality) and tools. It is designed for user flexibility in look-and-feel, as well as being adaptable to the user's choice in tools and operating systems.

Established in 2003, CEGUI sees continual, active development and remains one of the most powerful and most popular options for developers requiring an adaptable and efficient GUI solution.

CEGUI is fully supported by the developers that created - and continue to develop - the library, and who are accessible via the project's dedicated internet forums and IRC channel.

Thanks to its multi-file encoding feature, it may be the fastest a/v batch encoder available, since it maximizes system resources usage by launching as many simultaneous processes up to user cpu thread count. You can change encoding priority, pause and resume, set automatic shutdown. It is good for seasoned ffmpeg users as well as beginners.

It provides unlimited single or multi-file batch encoding for almost any audio/video format. You can use any set of parameters and try them before starting encoding.
