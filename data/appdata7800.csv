"Released under 'Creative Commons v3' license Alien Cipher is an endevour to build my own symmetric cipher.

The primary aim is to simply learn the fundementals and finer details of cryptography in general and build working examples of my ideas in code.

The code is shared here for prosterity (future folk) in the guise that it may help others also on the path to cryptography.

This code demo uses a 512bit rolling hash table (8x8bytes) at its heart to mix together pre-defined parameters in a way that allows the cipher to produce encoded output that is locked to a key of arbitrary length without padding.

Based upon some random data points the cipher produces encoded output that is non-deterministic in nature, ie the same key and message will never produce the same output each time it's run.

The cipher attempts to render output that is resistant to several types of analysis although this has yet to be proven.

Please note that I make no claims to this being safe.
