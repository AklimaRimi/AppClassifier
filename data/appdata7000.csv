"Mega Switcher is a new interface for Equalizer APO :
- It's geared towards listening sessions (for 1 or 2 users simultaneously),
- It provides an easy way to manage your own collection of audio devices and all their EQ presets, using the power of Equalizer APO.
Full control is at your fingertips!

Headphones (AE-OE and IE) and Loudspeakers are supported. HeSuVi is supported too.

15.000 headphone EQ presets are included : Harman presets (thanks to the AutoEQ and Oratory1990 databases) and Optimum HiFi presets (derived from the Harman presets). A multi-band parametric EQ helps you fine-tune settings even further on the fly.

Everything is managed via a simple interface, keyboard hotkeys and a Tray Menu, so you can quickly switch EQ presets and sound modes. The small unobtrusive GUI gives you just the right amount of info at any given moment.

"It's a side project that I made for myself since when I use my own mechanical keyboard at late night or in the office and my parents and my coworkers hate that a lot because the sound of the keyboard is very loud (especially in quiet places). So if you are facing this issue just like me then this product is for you!

- Plays typewriter sound

- You can add more keyboard sound set by recording any sound you like and add them to this app with some easy steps.

- Use your laptop keyboard or non-mechanical keyboard at work and still hear your loved sound.

- Use this app as any purpose as you want (such as demo for the buyer about the keyboard sound before they buy it, custom any sound for any key...)

With Mechvibes Editor, you can create a new sound pack, edit existing sound pack or share them with your friends.It's a side project that I made for myself since when I use my own mechanical keyboard at late night or in the office and my parents and my coworkers hate that a lot because the sound of the keyboard is very loud (especially in quiet places).

With Volume Step Adjuster you can set this volume step to any valid value, for example, you can set the volume step to 1% or even 0.1%.

fix crash at playback startup when asio driver version < 2.

Changes in 2.0.1:
sound problems with lossy codecs:WMA, MP3 used with gapless convolver, fixed

Changes in 2.0:
more stable version: tested with more codecs, 24 bits asio works now.
version optimized for CPUs with AVX2 (e.g. Intel Haswell and newer)

Thanks to Mo Philips for his help in developing this release with his wise and in-depth tests.An alternative to the official wasapi and Asio foobar2000 output component:
WASAPI output Support 3.2.3
ASIO output Support 2.1.2

"HEVC was developed with the goal of providing twice the compression efficiency of the previous standard, H.264 / AVC. Although compression efficiency results vary depending on the type of content and the encoder settings, at typical consumer video distribution bit rates HEVC is typically able to compress video twice as efficiently as AVC. End-users can take advantage of improved compression efficiency in one of two ways (or some combination of both);
