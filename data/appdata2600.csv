Serial Tool is a utility for developing serial communications, custom protocols or device testing. You can set up bytes to send accordingly to your protocol and save configuration to a file – which can be used another time.
You can send multiple byte arrays, you can send sequence of different byte arrays and put delay between them. You can read data in HEX or ASCII. You can even write a note to yourself like: “CH1: toggle LED 1”.PROJECT MOVED TO: https://github.com/damogranlabs/serial-tool
