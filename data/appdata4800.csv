"SmartSlog (Smart Space Ontology) is a software/application development kit (SDK or ADK) for programming Smart-M3 agents (Knowledge Processors, KPs) that consume/produce smart space content according with its high-level ontological representation. SmartSlog applies the code generation approach: given an OWL ontology description, the ontology programming library is produced. The latter provides API to access the smart space via a Smart-M3 Semantic Information Broker (SIB) and data structures and functions to represent and maintain locally in KP code all ontology classes, relations, properties, and individuals.

Since 2012 the project is supported by grant KA179 of Karelia ENPI programme, http://kareliaenpi.eu/
