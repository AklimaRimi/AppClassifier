The design of LogicalDOC is based on best-of-breed Java technologies in order to provide a reliable DMS platform. The main interface is web-based, no need to install anything else; users can access the system through their browser.

LogicalDOC CE is 100% free software and is packaged with an open source database; while it supports all major DBMS, developers still recommend MySQL for production systems.","Categories
