As the purpose of PICSimLab is to emulate real hardware it does not have any source code editing support. For code editing and debugging the same tools used for a real board should be used with PICSimLab, such as MPLABX, Arduino IDE, or VSCode with PlatformIO.
PICSimLab supports several devices (spare parts) that can be connected to the boards for simulation. Such as example LEDs and push buttons for simple outputs and inputs and some more complex ones like the ethernet shield w5500 for internet connection or the color graphic display ili9340 with touchscreen.

With JMCAD, users can quickly develop software or ""virtual"" prototypes of systems or processes to demonstrate their behavior prior to building physical prototypes.

The user builds his system model by selecting predefined blocks from a block library and simply wiring the blocks together. Each block of the diagram performs a function. Users can also create custom blocks in Java and add them to the JMCAD block library.

"This project is dedicated to open source data quality and data preparation solutions. Data Quality includes profiling, filtering, governance, similarity check, data enrichment alteration, real time alerting, basket analysis, bubble chart Warehouse validation, single customer view etc. defined by Strategy.

This tool is developing high performance integrated data management platform which will seamlessly do Data Integration, Data Profiling, Data Quality, Data Preparation, Dummy Data Creation, Meta Data Discovery, Anomaly Discovery, Data Cleansing, Reporting and Analytic.

It also had Hadoop ( Big data ) support to move files to/from Hadoop Grid, Create, Load and Profile Hive Tables. This project is also known as ""Aggregate Profiler""

Resful API for this project is getting built as (Beta Version) https://sourceforge.net/projects/restful-api-for-osdq/
