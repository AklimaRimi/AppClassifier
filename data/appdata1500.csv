"QP real-time embedded frameworks (RTEFs) provide lightweight, modern event-driven architecture based on active objects (actors) and hierarchical state machines. The matching QM model-based design tool and other host-based tools complement the QP frameworks by supporting graphical modeling, code generation, software tracing and unit testing for event-driven embedded software. Visit https://www.state-machine.com for more information.

The QP RTEFs can run on bare-metal single-chip microcontrollers, completely replacing a traditional RTOS. The frameworks contain a selection of built-in real-time kernels (RTOS kernels), such as the cooperative QV kernel, the preemptive non-blocking QK kernel, and the unique preemptive, dual-mode (blocking/non-blocking) QXK kernel. Native QP ports and ready-to-use examples are provided for ARM Cortex-M (M0/M0+/M3/M4F/M7) as well as other CPUs.

The QP RTEFs can also work with many traditional RTOSes and desktop OSes, such as Linux and Windows.QP real-time embedded frameworks (RTEFs) provide lightweight, modern event-driven architecture based on active objects (actors) and hierarchical state machines.

"libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.

libjpeg-turbo implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API. libjpeg-turbo also features colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from/decompress to 32-bit and big-endian pixel buffers (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), as well as a full-featured Java interface.libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems.

A tool to draw various charts from textual descriptions. Currently, three types of charts are supported: Message Sequence Charts, generic Graphs, and Block Diagrams, with more to be added in the future. There is a command-line version for Linux and Mac (replacing mscgen), which now sports a GUI, as well.

Msc-generator allows fine control over the appearance and has a rich feature set complete with detailed documentation. On Windows, you can embed the charts in a document or presentation and simply double-click it in Office to edit them. On Linux and the Mac, a command-line version is available, and a GUI, as well.
