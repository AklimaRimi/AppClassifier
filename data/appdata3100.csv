Google Map Gps Cell Phone Tracker has a responsive design using twitter bootstrap! Google Map Gps Cell Phone Tracker includes clients for IOS, Android, Windows Phone and Java Me/J2ME cell phones.

The project allows you to track cell phones periodically. For instance, every minute or every five minutes. With Google Map Gps Cell Phone Tracker, you can watch the cell phone being tracked in real time and you can store and reload routes easily.

With Google Map Gps Cell Phone Tracker, you have the choice of two server stacks. Either using asp.net and Sql Server or using php and mySQL, postgreSQL or Sqlite. Both are included in the same download but you only need to use one.

thanks
