"Jafama (Java Fast Math) consists of fast - but not sloppy - counterparts of java.lang.Math treatments, plus additional ones.

They are usually about 2-4 (up to 15) times faster, with about 1e-15 accuracy, and handle special cases (NaN, etc.).

Since version 2.1, a StrictFastMath class is also provided. It is a strictfp version of FastMath (and not a fast version of StrictMath): for a same version of this library, its methods always return a same result for same arguments, which might not be the case for FastMath depending on JIT or other JVM optimizations.

Requires Java 5 or later.

"Linear Program Solver (LiPS) is an optimization package oriented on solving linear, integer and goal programming problems.
The main features of LiPS are:
● LiPS is based on the efficient implementation of the modified simplex method that solves large scale problems.
● LiPS provides not just an answer, but a detailed solution process as a sequence of simplex tables, so you can use it for studying/teaching linear programming.
● LiPS gives sensitivity analysis procedures, which allow us to study the behaviour of the model when you change its parameters, including: analysis of changes in the right sides of constraints, analysis of changes in the coefficients of the objective function, analysis of changes in the column/row of the technology matrix. Such information may be extremely useful for the practical application of LP Models.
● LiPS provides methods of goal programming, including lexicographic and weighted GP methods, which are oriented on multi-objective optimisation.Linear Program Solver (LiPS) is an optimization package oriented on solving linear, integer and goal programming problems.

"WavePacket is a program package for numerical simulation of quantum-mechanical wavepacket dynamics of distinguishable particles. It can be used to solve single or coupled time-independent or time-dependent (linear) Schrödinger and Liouville-von Neumann-equations, partly also classical or quantum-classical Liouville equations. Optionally accounting for the interaction with external electric fields within the semiclassical dipole approximation, WavePacket can be used to simulate modern experiments involving ultrashort light pulses in photo-induced physics or chemistry, including quantum optimal control. Allowing for visualization of dynamics 'on the fly', WavePacket is easy to use .
