"A pronounceable password generator plugin for KeePass.


DISCLAIMER:
Compared to traditional randomly generated passwords of the same length, pronounceable passwords are inherently weaker against brute force attacks. Using pronounceable passwords sacrifice some resistance against brute force attacks to reduce the risk of inadvertent password exposure. Whether this trade-off is worth it or not depends entirely on your use case.

When using this application I recommend generating considerably longer passwords to make any brute force attack as difficult as possible. This application uses FIPS-181 for generating passwords and it is particularly vulnerable to brute force attacks that are targeted specifically towards the algorithm. I added modifications to the implementation (such as allowing the insertion of random numbers or symbols between syllables) with the intention of protecting against a targeted attack, but I cannot make any supported claims as to its effectiveness.A pronounceable password generator plugin for KeePass.

This enhanced security adds some delay ONLY to the opening of encrypted partitions without any performance impact to the application use phase. This is acceptable to the legitimate owner but it makes it much harder for an attacker to gain access to the encrypted data.

"Many a times when we connect our PenDrive to a PC or Laptop,
wedon't see our files and folders, instead see one or multiple
shortcuts.

Assuming these shortcuts as innocent, we launch them which in
turn infects our PC or laptop with a virus which the geeks call
Win32:Atraps-PZ[Trojan]

Simply speaking, the shortcut creates a backdoor to your system
so that it can access all your files,services and privileges
within that system & all others connected to it without your permission.

This is where HFV comes to help...Simply paste the location of your
Infected directory on the box & click Delete virus to get rid of virus.
As a safety precaution, keep this software backed up on system as well
since the virus which hides all files and creates a shortcut can also
hide this software as well.
P.S.It can also be used to hide your private data from Neighbors and Roommates;)Many a times when we connect our PenDrive to a PC or Laptop,
