"Based on HL7 v.2.3.1 Orders & Results Reference Information Model (RIM)s, The project is NOT a CPOE per-se. Instead, the project provides ""applications"" that allow EHR's to perform Outpatient Orders and Results via HIE, and collect these into their EHRs to feed the EHR ""CPOE module / section"" (ex. with prescribed drugs, ordered labs and results, ....)

The first module in the project was the ""ePrescribing application""; certified by RxHub and SureScripts back in 2007. New implementation needs to ""re-certify"" with SureScripts (which should not be much of a problem)

Work on eLabs (using ELINCS, LOINC etc.) is being considered as participants join the project become available.

The HL7 RIM allows for eImaging applications, eConsults applications, eReferrals applications, etc. Applications work independently, but through HIE, results come back to the provider to see it in its ""CPOE Section or Module""

Requires licensing of the MediSpan Drug Database for ePrescribBased on HL7 v.2.3.1 Orders & Results Reference Information Model (RIM)s, The project is NOT a CPOE per-se.
